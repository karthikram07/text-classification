R259V1H8TBEFMN,Shivalik Halder,"I have been using the Oneplus Buds Z2 for more than a 1.5 years now and that is perhaps the best TWS headphones at that given price. It has great features, great sound, great battery life and good noise cancellation. But I was still searching for another TWS. Why? Because I am not a fan of bass. My only two reasons for not liking the Buds Z2 is that it is bass heavy, and it is too loud. This is what most people want, but my music preferences are not like that. So when I read reviews about the Sony WF C500, I thought of buying it. But that changed was that I got the Song WF C700N at under 5000 in the Great Indian Festival. And what impressed me most the most is the sound. The sound isn‚Äôt too bassy. It balanced. Some might call it flat and boring too. Because it won‚Äôt excite you if you are someone who loves bass. But I loved the sound. I was amazed what a 5 mm dynamic driver could do. Yes, small driver means the volume isn‚Äôt as loud as Oneplus, but I could never use the Oneplus over 20 percent volume as it would hurt my ears. The Sony is much more soft and has a warm sound tone. It packs good punch and if you want you have a full equaliser at your disposal in the Headphones Connect app. And you can play along with the already created profiles or make custom ones. Adjust the sound to your likings and you will be amazed at the sound. The connection is easy too and the app is easy to use. I would say for the price I got it at, the sound punches much above the class.But that‚Äôs about it. If you look for features, look away. The buds have a continuous battery backup of around 8 hours approximately and the case holds one additional charge. You will get approximately 16 hours of playtime with ANC turned on. The case takes 3 hours ro fully charge however there is a fast charge feature where you can charge for 10 mis and use for some 2-4 hours. There are no touch controls, however the buttons are very tactile and a breeze to use. The buds have IPX4 though. And it is one of the lightest set of TWS I have ever used. So don‚Äôt look for any features. As the competition offer much more at lesser price.But that I loved, I will repeat again, is the sound. And the customisation available for the sound. The experience is premium. The connection is easy for both Android and iOS. For someone who loves to play around with different types of music, this is a great pair of TWS if you get it under 6000 I would say. This would be an audiophile‚Äôs dream budget TWS if you look at it that way. But it for the amazing sound and nothing else.",Reviewed in India on 10 October 2023,Premium sound and that‚Äôs all there is to offer,5.0 out of 5 stars,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cpAPs-0mL.jpg,47,Black,WF-C700N,sony,,,"build quality: 2

RWQJMLFYBAIMT,Amazon Customer,"After 10 days of use, in my opinion these are a good pair of earbuds in terms of sound quality. The body doesn't look premium to me even though the original price is of the premium range.Sound wise it performs decent. It fits well. You can even try head banging, it wouldn't get off.Few issues I found:1. I have used premium ear buds which have the touch/pinch feature to operate on the media playing on the device, and they didn't respond many times to the touch and i feel the tactile button on the earbuds is a good replacement for that. In general, there is no problem with the buttons, but you cant lie down sideways as there are chances that the button will squeeze between your head and pillow, thus pausing the media or whatever you set as the button action.2. Comfort: I have used OnePlus pro ear buds which i could wear all day, but this one, i cant. I dont think i can wear it even for an hour without taking them off. It doesn't hurt a lot, but I can certainly feel some discomfort. If you are someone who would wear them all them all day, then it might not be for you.",Reviewed in India on 8 November 2023,Decent earbuds,4.0 out of 5 stars,,2,Black,WF-C700N,sony,,,"build quality: 2

R246Z9Q1U9SFR3,KAUSHIK,"It is the first time in my life I've considered a bluetooth earphone. Received the product. Unboxed it, read the manual, paired it with phone. No trouble. Sound is standard issue, as claimed on the detailed reviews on internet. Nothing extraordinary.I check the range on first day, around 10 metres after which the audio starts breaking. Used it for 3 days without any issues, both the units working and battery charging as usual.After 3 days, the right bud disconnects randomly. Try pressing the button on it but no play/pause response on phone. I notice that it said ""power o...power o...power o..."". It couldn't successfully power on or connect to bluetooth. Put it in the case for a minute and it was good. Also that day the right unit began losing signal suddenly, despite being within 2 or 3 metres of the phone, line of sight being unblocked. I thought maybe it happens in bluetooth earphones and isn't a big issue.The issue amplified in the upcoming days. The right unit kept losing signal and kept powering off itself randomly, sometimes it could power on sometimes it couldn't.Today, it couldn't even power on after putting it in case. All I could hear is a static sound coming on and off in a few seconds from the right unit, its trying to do something but it isnt succeeding.I brought it for Rs 5666 in Feb 2023 from seller Appario. I've ordered several items from them in the past and they've not let me down.I've concluded that this unit is a bust. Bad luck, I got a lemon. Should have doubted that something is wrong with it when it was selling for a discount. There are manufacturing issues with 1 to 5% of the products, that's how good things are manufactured these days, so when you end up with something defective it's a sour experience. And before you ask, I've been taking great care of them by not wearing them in weird places like toilet and shower.Warranty is a thorny road, and so is replacement. The amount of red tape surrounding warranty is obnoxious. Since I trusted Sony name I took a chance that these units will last but they didnt and my chance for asking a replacement gone. Got no other option other than biting the bullet and eat the cost. Even if I get a replacement, this lemon is going to end up in refurbished market where some other poor fellow would buy this sour lemon again and get his taste soury.Bottom line- be ready to eat the cost of product in case it's a lemon, don't rely on warranty and replacement policies because they are always tipped in favour of the seller/manufacturer.Update: Made up my mind to dispose it off.

R3DZBZ95AL5J5F,Akhil,"Pros:Sound 4/5Comfort 5/5Anc:4/5Connecitivity : 4/5Sound profile is the best in the segment after you tweak some settings in the Sony headphone app. The 'excited' option in equalizer sounded best to me. Although you could get even better after you adjust equalizer. And I preferred sound quality over connecitivity in the settings. Voice prompt turned off.Con:Battery: Only issue I'm facing is that the earbuds charging is stuck at 100 and not draining. I've been using it for atleast 3 hours a day but the battery won't drop. However initially the left ear bud was showing uneven battery drain, it went from 100 to 20 in less than 45 mins.  Hopefully I get the product replaced from Sony. Will update .Update: (14-08-13) Apparently the battery drain in left earbud was evident only when connected to tv. The battery being stuck at 100 resolved on it's own. Not sure why it happened.

R11U2YMVWCHIQ,Abhirup Banerjee,The fit in the ear and the sound quality of the buds are excellent. It is very comfortable in the ear unlike some other TWS earbuds available in the market. The sound quality can be adjusted according to your linking using the Sony Headphones app. ANC and Ambiant sound mode works great. The only one small flaw is that the battery indicator on the Sony Headphones app is incorrect. It does not seem to reduce from 100% due to some wierd reason. This issue can be fixed with an update in the app easily.

I got these for 3k so it's a fair deal but they are not worthy if you buy these for more than 3.5k.If you want to experience a good bass keep volume at around 70% an they are even better than apple air pods.

R1RF5ABI2LCTLI,dvn,"This is a well built, good sounding pair of wireless earphones for the price (I got them for around 3,500 with offers) from a reputable brand. The battery lasts forever one on charge, which is useful for me as I spend long hours on my computer or phone every day for work. All I have to do is put them back in the little box and charge the whole thing before I go to bed. The mic quality isn't as good as other (pricier) earphones but is a noticeable upgrade on your phone's mic for video conferencing, so good enough for me.They actually sound surprisingly good for the price. Can't really compare with airpods or good over-ear headphones but I don't really think the drop in quality is that big of a deal. These are well made. My only real gripe about these earphones is that they aren't the most comfortable to wear. The left side is fine, but for me the right seems just a little uncomfortably large. It starts to hurt after an hour if I have it sitting in snugly. This could just be a me problem, as I haven't extensively used other in-ear wireless buds before, but maybe something to keep in mind for you.

RSKH8ZQS5H0TJ,Adithyan S R,"Well...there's so many negative reviews here and people are even comparing these to Boat and what not ü§¶First of all...it's a Sony .. I've been a Sony user for ages .. I've been using MHC-V71D since 2018... And guess what ..this small buds is providing the same quality and functionality as that of the ‚Çπ40 K party speaker...So talking about the positives :1. Sony Connect App : If you really are an audiophile this app is an essential tool.. like I said ..we can choose a range of preset sound fields (or create custom ones) on the app...and yes...it will take some time to get used to one..once thats set then its üí•  ...( I suggest switching it into ""Excited"" sound field , which has equal amount of bass and vocal quality  )2. Battery Life : it does what it claims ..using it for 4.5 hours continuously causes only 30% fall in battery.3. Design : it looks premium...feels premium..and build quality is evident.. the magnet is too strong...you can feel it ...the buds won't fall off from the case no matter what..4. Sound signature : one must really try the 360 reality audio inorder to feel the difference between normal stereo and spatial audio ...it picks even the smallest sounds from every corner and provides an enriched ambient sound..the vocals are crisp...bass is sufficient .. overall sound quality is worth the price5. Comfort : talking about comfort ..yes...it's comfortable for long hour use ..the max time I spend on it was for 6 hours and I didn't felt any pain/fatigue or anything6. Bluetooth connectivity : once paired the buds will connect the moment you take it out of the case...and you will get an uninterrupted quality connection over long distancesNow let's talk about the ok-ok part :1. Fit : the buds feels really tucked into the ears and yes there's set of different sizes in the box ...but I constantly feel like they may fall off  ( I tried to intentionally make it fall off by shaking my head and doing things but it didn't fell off...but I do have a fear that it may fall off )2. Material : The material and colour looks cool in real life...but if your are opting for the light coloured versions (green/orange/white) you should always be aware to keep your fingers clean...or otherwise the buds will somewhat attract anything that's on your hand ( and yes you can easily wipe it off and clean it ..but I prefer not to make them dirty as it may in the long run ruin the colour)Ok...now to the negatives1. Mic quality : call quality is great ...but it'll feel somewhat ok...the reason : the mic picks up each and every sound around you ....so if you are having a conversation in a closed environment with minimal noise then the quality will be good... otherwise in outdoor conditions it's not that great  ..and I don't prefer these ones for professional meeting stuffs or anything like that because of the above said factors....and don't even think about using this as a mic for recording ...2. The ""Hissss"" : well it's not distracting for me ..you can hear it...you can feel it...but it won't be a nuisance ...atleast for me ... After using for some days you won't even notice it that much3. Latency : sometimes can feel a small delay..and it's not that much distractingSo that's all about thisAnd let me tell you who should get this :Anyone who needs a high quality ambient sound experience in a small packageThose whos lazy to charge it every once and thenArtists/Students/WFH/or anybody who needs uninterrupted music for hoursMovie watching buddiesSomeone who mostly have conversations in a somewhat silent environment ie, indoorsAnd those who shouldn't buy this :Professionals with meetings and calls throughout the whole day who have to attend calls at everywhereVloggers who's planning to use this as a micThe Outdoor peopleThose who don't even know the difference between a mono and stereo ü§∑ü§¶So that's all about the WF-C500THANK YOU !!",Reviewed in India on 21 February 2022,READ THIS IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY !,4.0 out of 5 stars,,2,Orange,WF-C500/Orange,sony,,,"build quality: 3

R38KTWSJNXRYAT,Anup Singh,"I wanted to buy wireless earbuds for under Rs. 2500/- but after doing so much research I found that the earbuds that come under Rs. 2500 (like, Oneplus earbuds, Oppo earbuds, etc.) were not giving me features that I was looking for and that was Great Sound.Under Rs.2500 earbuds were giving other features like Noise Cancellation, long battery life, etc., etc. But they were not giving a sound experience. Even expensive Samsung did not give that sound experience that Sony gives.It was out of my budget but somehow I managed to buy it and now I can say it was a great decision to buy these earbuds.I only recommend this for Sound Quality. The Sound quality of these earbuds is better than I expected.

R19CSCEBHH3B0F,Mohit,"The product is good for sound quality. I have tested it with iPad and Android phone and it works a little better with iPad on Spotify and Apple music. Actually it works great with Apple music because they have lossless audio quality.If you are buying these earbuds then you would have to get the subscription of either the apple music or Spotify, otherwise it won't be able to give that great clear sound quality.As far as call quality is concerned, not to buy this if call quality is in your priority list. Call quality is okay okay.Gaming... I don't play game so, I don't know.No issues while watching movies or watching YouTube.Build quality... I think it's great üëç, it should last more than 5 years easily.Battery... For me it's greatüëç. I can easily go more than a week without changing it. But I don't listen often. Basically if you use 2 hours daily for combined usages then it should last you a week atleast.EQ app ( sony connect ) is actually good. You can tune things accordingly to your taste and songs. Like for old songs you can set the pre set ""vocals"" that would erase the base and will give clear vocals, you can also choose pre set ""bright"" that would give you vocals and awesome instrument separation, and for other I prefer ""excited"" preset. This one gives balance of everything with a little more emphasis on the bass. You can make your own presets in the App.About 360 audio, nothing special and don't think about it as Spatial audio of Apple ( though I haven't heard it ) but I know this 360 is not comparable to Spatial audio. To put it simply, it just the Dolby Atmos sound quality ( that surround sound quality) again you need music of that sound quality for that. I personally didn't like 360 audio and I just don't get it why the hell it even exist? ?? ü§î.Ohh I forgot to tell you about convenience. Yess you will get that airpods like convenience if you chose buy these earbuds. Actually, I have sony xb-400 ( that neckband earphones ).The biggest issue I faced with xb - 400 , is that they always get entangled and you always need to be careful about the wire. Also the whole experience of using it is trouble some. You need to press the botton to switch on the Bluetooth in the earphones and then you need to switch on the Bluetooth of your phone and then try to connect it ( often it doesn't get connected by itself) so you need to go to the settings in your phone then in Bluetooth and then it can get connected. Sometimes I had to restart my phone.But in this earbuds, I just take them out put it in my ear then it automatically get connected. I don't have to do anything it works üòÉ like magic. ( Though you just need to let the Bluetooth of your phone open all time.) It doesn't eat lot of battery, I have checked it, it's almost negligible.Now that's called convenience üòÖ. And it does feel like money spent well.üòÉOverall, if you want the great sound quality with awesome bass. You can easily pick these earbuds, and you won't regret it.Don't buy neckbands, they are outdated and not contemporary to the current lifestyle. It's a fact because wherever you see, people are using earbuds not neckband or earphones.",Reviewed in India on 17 November 2022,Buy only for sound quality.,4.0 out of 5 stars,,137,Orange,WF-C500/Orange,sony,,,"build quality: 3

Then you can go for it considering you are getting this pair for 3k. Bass is punchy and clear you can also use the sony equalizer for increasing bass an treble.  I really love the sound signature they are not shouty some people might find this not loud enough, bass is thumpy . It fits well in ear canal. It's not the best option in 3k budget but it's sound will surely let you down. Plus there's a trust factor when a buy a reputed brands product.A tip: use the biggest eartip whilenusing these tws , it will give you a more secure fit , nice bass and treble.

R3RE38OETKXLGF,Kuldeep Kumar,"First of all I am writing this review after using these extensively for about 8 months and I was so impressed with the overall sound quality, functionality and battery backup of these TWS that I bought three of these. Two from amazon and one from offline market.PROS1. Sound Quality: The sound quality is great for this budget. You will enjoy watching movies and listening to songs on these. The trebble is good so you will hear the dialogs very clearly. Base is decent at this price point but don‚Äôt expect them to be too good on the base as these are budget TWS but again the sound is great for what you are paying for.2. Battery Backup: For this budget the battery backup on these tiny things is outstanding. You can easily watch a full 3.5 to 4 hour movie without worrying that the battery will die. Infact, I have even used these straight for more than 4 hours and its battery never gave up on me. Adding to that, the case itself has its own battery so the buds will charge as soon as you put them back in the case so basically the battery lasts for more than a week if you use them daily on regular basis for 3-4 hours daily.3. Durability: After using them for about 8 months I can assure you that these will not fail on you and are very durable. All three of them which I bought are working fine without any issues. I also suggested them to some of my friends and collegues and their TWS are also working fine till date.4. Touch Sensors: You get touch sensors on each of the buds which you can use to play, pause, skip tracks, next and previous songs in the list, picking up calls etc.5. Latency: On normal mode I didn‚Äôt find them lagging behind but if you want to use them for gaming with super low latency then it comes with something called ‚ÄòBEAST MODE‚Äô which further improves latency but at the cost of faster battery drain. So you can definitely use them for gaming. To switch to ‚ÄòBeast Mode‚Äô just tap thrice on the touch sensors on any of the buds.6. Size: These are tiny. You can see the photo where I have put them besides a AA battery to have an idea of their size. So you can put these in your pocket without making them bulky. These are super portable.7. USB C Charging: These have a USB C port for charging so you can charge these easily with your phone charger. You can also find a USB A to C charging cable inside the box.8. Connectivity: Pairing these with your phone is super simple and quick. The phone remembers the connection so when you turn your Bluetooth on next time it will connect automatically to these. Moreover, you can use only one bud at a time and keep the other one in the case and later one if you do decide to use both then you can simple take out the other one from the case and it will connect automatically with the one already connected to your phone.9. Different size ear plugs: These also comes with different size ear plugs so you can pick one that fits your ears for better comfort.10. Fast charging: Once you put the earbuds inside the case they charge real fast so even if they run out of battery (which they don‚Äôt, trust me) you can charge them up in just 5 minutes for almost an hour of playback.11. Battery level LEDs: The case have four LEDs on the front that shows you the battery level and charging status. You can also see the battery percentage of the buds on the phone when they are connected to it.CONS:1. Build: Though the build is very good, out of three I bought two of them came with a loose cap that was a little wobbly. Though the wobble was very minimum but still I felt that the build quality is not consistent.2. Less Base: The base not these TWS is not that great but as I said these are budget TWS that comes with decent base for the price.3. Range: The range is surely not their strength. You will loose connection if you go far from your source OR will experience sound drop if anything like wall etc. comes between these TWS and the source. But if you are sitting close to the source with clear line of sight in 3-5 m radius then you will have best connection without any signal drops. Additionally I also experienced signal drops when they have almost 20 to 30% battery left so make sure you keep the buds and case charged above these levels.4. Not for workouts: These will slip from your ears if you use them for intense workouts or jogging as they don‚Äôt have the ear hooks.5. Battery percentage: You cannot see the exact battery percentage for the case as it does not have a display.6. USB C Cable: The supplied USB C cable is very short as you can see in the pictures. But since everyone will most likely charge them using their phone charges so it‚Äôs not a big deal.7. Microphone: Each of the earbuds have a microphone built in for calling but when I tried these over a call, I got a feedback from my friend that he was not hearing my voice very well when compared to my phone‚Äôs inbuilt microphone. So I don‚Äôt recommend these for attending voice calls.",Reviewed in India on 12 July 2023,Budget-friendly with Great Sound and Battery Backup!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6187p7fuGXL.jpg

R3ENKUSVAR2PL,RVS,"The boAt Airdopes 141 are wireless earbuds that offer a decent sound quality, long battery life, and low latency mode for gaming. They are also IPX4 water-resistant and have touch controls and voice assistant support. However, they also have some drawbacks, such as a bulky case, average noise cancellation, and lack of volume control on the earbuds. Here are some pros and cons of the boAt Airdopes 141:ProsSound quality: The earbuds have 8mm dynamic drivers that deliver clear and balanced sound with good bass. The boAt signature sound is immersive and enjoyable for most genres of music12Battery life: The earbuds have a playback time of up to 6 hours per charge and an additional 36 hours with the case. They also support ASAP fast charge technology that gives up to 75 minutes of playtime with just 5 minutes of charging. The case has a Type-C port for convenient charging12Low latency mode: The earbuds have a BEAST mode that reduces the audio lag while gaming or watching videos. The low latency mode can be activated by tapping the left earbud three times. This feature enhances the gaming experience and syncs the audio with the video12IPX4 water resistance: The earbuds are protected from water and sweat splashes with an IPX4 rating. This makes them suitable for outdoor activities and workouts. They can withstand light rain and sweat without any damage12Touch controls and voice assistant: The earbuds have quick response touch controls that allow you to play/pause music, answer/reject calls, activate voice assistant, and switch between modes. You can also access your default voice assistant (Siri or Google Assistant) with a single tap on the right earbud. The touch controls are responsive and easy to use12ConsBulky case: The case of the earbuds is quite large and heavy compared to other wireless earbuds in this price range. It may not fit easily in your pocket or bag. The case also has a glossy finish that attracts fingerprints and scratches easily34Average noise cancellation: The earbuds have ENx environmental noise cancellation technology that reduces the background noise during calls. However, the noise cancellation is not very effective and you may still hear some ambient sounds while listening to music or talking on the phone. The earbuds also do not have active noise cancellation (ANC) or transparency mode features that are available in some higher-end models34Lack of volume control: The earbuds do not have any option to adjust the volume level on the earbuds themselves. You have to use your phone or other connected device to change the volume. This can be inconvenient if you want to quickly lower or increase the volume without reaching for your phone34ConclusionThe boAt Airdopes 141 are wireless earbuds that offer good value for money with their sound quality, battery life, low latency mode, IPX4 water resistance, touch controls, and voice assistant support. They are ideal for casual listening, gaming, and workouts. However, they also have some drawbacks, such as a bulky case, average noise cancellation, and lack of volume control on the earbuds.

R1Z1HYU3W8EE83,Placeholder,My first impression on this product was okay-okay but quality of the sound was greater than my expectation at this price.Pros: 1. Different sound modes2. ANC mode is really good. When I working at office in this mode my neighbor colleagues were trying to call me (shouting) but I don't even hear a single word. üòÄ. This proves ANC was awesome.3. Battery backup is really good.Cons:1 There is no volume control on pods.2. The call answering button/touch didn't work well.3. The sound when it comes while pairing was  like haunting sound. They would have choose way better chimp sound.4. Mobile app on iOS didn't work.If you are only focusing on pods for good music go for it but you are a person who attend more phone calls this may be little annoying.,Reviewed in India on 4 January 2024,Great product,4.0 out of 5 stars,,2,White,with ANC,boat,,,"build quality: 2

R1T444SCBD9K2E,VEE,"I liked the sound quality. Previously I was using airdops 161 which had 13 mm drivers and trust me those sounded very bad due to overpowered bass and 8mm drivers in airdops 141 beat that in sound quality. 8mm doesn't mean it doesn't have bass. It has adequate amount of bass and trebles are good too. Case seems durable.I primarily bought it for music and it didn't disappoint me. Calling quality is ok, not bad. I don't play games so I didn't need low latency.Fit is ok but can't sleep on side with these.I bought it in 1.3k. Anyway, If you can grab it at 1.1k-1.2k would be a good deal.I'll change rating to 5 if it lasts 1 year at least.Only one con; Wish boat had provided us app to control touch gestures, just like Realme's realme link  and oppo's hey melody app.",Reviewed in India on 24 December 2023,Better than Airdops 161,4.0 out of 5 stars,,4,Pure White,Without ANC,boat,,,"build quality: 2

R15VU576KDCPNJ,Shalini A.,I recently got the product and I had to say that the quality of the packaging was pretty good and it gave a premium kind of feel. The product quality is good but more work can be done to make the earbuds resistent to fall damage. the ANC is good enough to block sounds like fan or cooler or ac exhaust if they are a bit far in the room and the ambient mode and normal mode are good too and work as expected. sound quality is very decent although not much bass is to be expected and the two audio modes are pretty good although couldn't hear much of a difference yet. battery life is great doesn't require much charge and it also connects fast with mobile although it may take time or manual work in laptops and for the price its pretty good although a few quality issues can be resolved and the cable provided can be made longer if possible as most wall adapters are way of the ground or table. will  update review in futureUPDATE : alright it has been a while and I have been using this regularly and I have spotted a problem that it more often than not it out of nowhere disconnects and you have to comnect it again by tapping its name in Bluetooth setting in the phone which is very annoying and sometimes it will happen a few times in a row although it might be a battery issue but its something I would expect not to happen after paying this much price also I have found that bass is better sounding in signature sound mode,Reviewed in India on 2 September 2023,best ANC tws in the price range,4.0 out of 5 stars,,151,Gunmetal Black,with ANC,boat,,,"build quality: 2

R3TV89WGE6PPK8,abhijeet mane,"Design and Build (4/5):The Boat Airdopes 141 ANC earbuds boast a sleek and modern design, earning them points for aesthetics. The charging case feels sturdy and pocket-friendly. However, they lose a point due to their slightly bulky form factor. The earbuds themselves are comfortable and secure in-ear.Audio Quality (2.5/5):Here's where the Boat Airdopes 141 ANC fall short. While they are acceptable for casual listening, the audio quality is a major letdown. The sound lacks the depth and richness expected from premium earbuds. It's almost akin to using a pair of 100rs headphones, which is disappointing for a product in this price range.Noise Cancellation (3/5):The active noise cancellation on these earbuds is decent but not exceptional. It manages to reduce ambient noise to some extent but struggles in particularly noisy environments. The effectiveness is somewhat underwhelming when compared to other models in this category.Battery Life (4.5/5):One of the strong points of the Boat Airdopes 141 ANC is their battery life.Connectivity (5/5):The Boat Airdopes 141 ANC impress with their Bluetooth 5.3 technology, ensuring a fast and stable connection. Pairing is seamless, and the earbuds maintain a reliable connection without any noticeable dropouts during use.Controls and Features (3/5):While the touch controls are handy for managing playback and calls, there's a notable drawback. The earbuds tend to turn off when you activate the ANC, which can be quite frustrating. This feature inconsistency lowers the overall user experience.**Call Quality (4.5/5):**The call quality on these earbuds is commendable. They perform well in both quiet and moderately noisy environments, providing clear and distortion-free audio for conversations.**Conclusion (3/5):**In summary, the Boat Airdopes 141 ANC offer a mixed experience. They shine in terms of battery life and connectivity, but their audio quality disappoints, resembling that of budget headphones. The noise cancellation is acceptable but not outstanding, and the control quirks can be frustrating. If you prioritize battery life and connectivity and can compromise on audio quality, these earbuds might be suitable for you. However, if audio quality is paramount, you might want to explore other options in this price range.",Reviewed in India on 31 August 2023,Boat Airdopes 141 ANC -  Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ (3/5),3.0 out of 5 stars,,289,Gunmetal Black,with ANC,boat,,,"build quality: 4

R358NYWUQLR163,Dillip,"Pros:1. The level of volume it gets to, is just awesome, it can get incredibly loud so if you're at the gym, these are perfect.2. Awesome Bass!3. Noise cancellation is just great, if you simply put them on without even any music playing, u won't be able to hear things around u very well, it's great for places like Gym.4. Lovely battery life, I've had them a week and only had to charge the case once, that too for just a few minutes. And the earbuds themselves, leave them in case for just five min and you'll be getting battery for a long long while.5. They are very comfortable, can be used for long periods of time.6. Affordable!7. The touch controls are very responsive, tap to pause, double tap right one for next song, double tap left one for either rewind or previous song. Can also pick up calls just by tapping.8. Multiple ear coverings are provided with it.9. Type C portCons:1. The sound quality is not bad or anything but it is slightly muffled as compared to good quality headphones etc. The bass is the highlight so it's great for music, but for movies or gaming, you won't get the most crisp audio.2. Some connectivity issues, sometimes i have to turn my Bluetooth on and off many times for it to work (this is occasional, not a daily or frequent occurrence) [Edit after 1 month use: it's now a very frequent issue]3. The mic quality is good if you are using your phone, but for some reason the quality is really bad if you are on PC4. Sometimes on WhatsApp, the mic will not be detected if you are on call with these earbuds, so you will end up having to take them off to accept a call sometimes. (Not an issue if you are the one dialing) i hope it's just a whatsapp issue rather than earbuds issue.Overall, I needed these for my gym since they play horrible music there (lol) so I'm very very happy with themHighly recommended for music and/or as a more affordable option as compared to JBL etc.",Reviewed in India on 2 January 2023,great product under low price range,4.0 out of 5 stars,,298,Bold Black,Without ANC,boat,,,"build quality: 2

In my case, I got charging issue as the pods were not able to charge from the case and I was no longer able to use it again. In the time I used it, I got pairing and connectivity issues sometimes. The pods would automatically disconnect in the middle of nowhere and I had to turn off the Bluetooth on my phone and on it again multiple times to connect it again. Just so you know that my Bluetooth on the phone is not at all a problem cuz my phone is perfectly alright and pairs well with other devices I connect.I am giving only 3 because, It can improve more in terms of case quality and its charging fearure to bots cuz mine was that problem. One more is the pairing and connectivity issue. Also call quality can be improved. BUT I must say that the sound quality is exceptionally beyond my expectations.

R36WFDPRC6P5J4,Ashik Latheef,"Title: A Reliable Choice for Wireless EarbudsRating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ (4/5)I recently purchased a pair of true wireless earbuds, and after using them for a while, I can confidently say that they offer a satisfying listening experience with a few minor drawbacks.Pros:1. Sound Quality (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ): The sound quality of these earbuds is impressive, with clear highs and punchy bass. They provide an immersive audio experience, making music and podcasts enjoyable.2. Comfort (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ): The earbuds are comfortable to wear for extended periods. They come with multiple ear tip options, ensuring a snug fit and good passive noise isolation.3. Connectivity (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ): Pairing is straightforward, and the Bluetooth connection remains stable. The earbuds quickly connect to my devices, which is convenient.4. Battery Life (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ): The battery life is decent, offering several hours of playback on a single charge. The charging case provides additional hours, making them suitable for daily use.Cons:1. Build Quality (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ): While they feel lightweight and compact, the build quality leaves something to be desired. The plastic construction feels a bit flimsy, and I worry about their long-term durability.2. Touch Controls (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ): The touch controls can be a bit finicky. Sometimes, accidental touches occur when adjusting the earbuds, which can be frustrating.3. Microphone (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ): The microphone quality is below par, particularly in noisy environments. Call quality suffers, and it can be challenging for others to hear you clearly.4. Limited Features (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ): Compared to premium models, these earbuds lack some advanced features like active noise cancellation or advanced app integration.In summary, these true wireless earbuds are a reliable and budget-friendly choice for those seeking good sound quality and comfort. They are a suitable option for music enthusiasts and casual users. However, if you prioritize durability, advanced features, or crystal-clear call quality, you might want to consider higher-end alternatives.",Reviewed in India on 7 November 2023,good product,4.0 out of 5 stars,,6,Cider Cyan,Without ANC,boat,,,"build quality: 2

Great battery life.. With volume around 50-60% ANC on - buds: around 5hrs with case ‚âà30-32hrs depending on volume and without ANC increased by 0.5-1hr battery not close to advertised levelsCons:-1.Balanced sound is a gimmick, I've used several hires earphones with balanced sounds and had my expectations low but this managed to let me down further. Everything sounds tinny and hollow with no real warmth or quality to it. Seems like the drivers are turned to be bass heavy at factory and no amount of EQ tuning could bring them down to normal. Disappointed as I love balanced > bass heavy mode. Others might disagree as everyone seems to love bass in excess.2. Featherlight build(again) the case and buds feel fragile compared to the original boat 141 which felt like a tank.3. Can't use custom eartips apart from those in box as the case won't close with any eartips other than those given,used a boat 141(original )with custom Sony eartips ,they were perfect and was disappointed by the lack of support for this product4. Transparency mode is not good enough5. ANC fails at higher ambient sounds, passive cancellation on the old boat 141 was better compared to the ANC on this productIt's easy already crazy high how much bass majority of us Indians love, But nowadays it's reaching extreme levels, People who love and are used to Balanced audio on hi res earphones avoid them at all costs.

R2MVR88SCX8DHZ,Keekee,"This is the second pair of wireless earbuds that I've owned, but the first one that I bought.I've had them for 4 months at this point.‚úì The most important feature for me was the comfort of the buds. Most earbuds make my ears sore after any use longer than half an hour. I can wear these for hours at a time for days in a row if I want to.‚úì The noise canceling feature was also important for me. Even when they aren't in active noise canceling mode, I can't hear my partner (who has a deep and booming voice that's known to travel) when they're in the next room with the door open.‚úì The charging case can seem like it takes a while to fully charge, but I feel like it's worth it due to how long it stays charged and how many uses I can get from it.‚úì The sound quality is the best I've experienced from any headphone or earbud (not that I've tried a lot). The sound is clear, and I don't need to have my media up ridiculously high just to hear it anymore.‚úì The buds are magnetically pulled into their ports but aren't difficult to remove.‚úì It's perfect for traveling. The case is compact and the cord is short and comes in a little box to keep it organized.‚úó The case is sleek. I dropped it within seconds of picking it up out of the box because it slipped right out of my fingers.‚úó I was under the impression that I wouldn't need to install the app to use the different functions of the earbuds. It could be that I just haven't figured it out, but any time I try to delete the app, I have issues with getting the earbuds to work properly.‚úó Initially, I was impressed that these buds stayed in my ears as I went about my business, but it's gotten to a point where I do have to be mindful when they're in. If I smile too widely, they pop out. If I turn my head too fast or look up and to the side, they pop out. Sometimes they'll pop out when I bend to pick things up.",Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2024,"No regrets, will buy again if needed.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/512VdfVDbtL.jpg

R21BNLLQ5CEZW4,Amaze Custom,"I bought these mainly to listen to music handsfree while doing home chores. The sound is very good, but it is a bit base-dominant for my taste. The voices seem a bit ‚Äúmuffled‚Äù while the base is very sharp (feels like someone is making ‚Äúbom bom bom‚Äù sounds over the music). I can‚Äôt hear all the different instruments clearly (like I used to with my old, cheaper buds). I figure I might get used to it.The noise cancelling is decent, although I could hear water from the tap I had left running in the bathroom while listening to music in the next room (luckily, though, because I‚Äôd forgotten about the tap running. I thought there were river sounds in the song‚Ä¶).As for battery life, it is a distinct improvement! My older (cheaper) buds didn‚Äôt last one hour, even new.

R2I5Z8HUVWZ3OA,Kenton,"I'm going to do a pros and cons list to make this alot simpler, and so you can easily find what you would like to know.Pros:1. Overall great sound quality, no complaints really, and there is a eq app that allows you to customize the sound to your preference. Whether that be if you like more bass or a soft listening experience.2. Comfort is good on these earbuds, genuinely some of the most comfortable earbuds out there. And they come with different sized ear pieces. But comfort is subjective so your mileage may vary.3. Battery life is great, I very rarely need to charge them. You can definitely get 6 hours out of them on a full charge. And the case can store an additional 15 hours. It takes 15 min to charge the earbuds to full and 2 hours to charge the case to full.Cons:1. Noise cancelation is not great. Don't be expecting to jump on a plane and drown out the engine, talking, and inevitable crying baby. The anc is like a 4/102. If you don't have a samsung phone it will not be as seamless of an experience. Meaning widgets won't display battery percentage, you also won't get a pop up when connected telling you battery percentage. You won't be able to change eq settings either since the app you need is only on samsung devices. So my advice is to get the respected earbuds that pair with your phone. So, if you have a iPhone, get airpods. If you have a pixel, get pixel buds. Etc.3. Minor nit-pick but sometimes my earbuds will randomly disconnect, so I will have to put them back in the case and then put them back in my ears.4. The touch controls aren't very good. They aren't very responsive, So don't bother with them.Overall they are extremely good earbuds for the price. They are a great budget option for wireless earbuds that will surely not disappoint. And if you have Samsung phone they are even better, with all the features you gain by staying in the samsung ecosystem.",Reviewed in the United States on 20 August 2023,Great wireless earbuds for the price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,,108,,,samsung,,,"build quality: 2

RO46AEMG7IL2Q,Trey Brown,"Purchased these when they were on sale and was completely blown away!First thing that stood out was the active noise cancellation! Being able to go from noise cancellation to ambient sounds is great, especially for certain situations!If you're in a loud environment and want to listen to music/audio books - noise cancellation! If you want to listen to music but need to be aware of your surroundings and hear people - ambient sounds!  The noise cancellation blocks out roughly 80-90% of the total outside sound; its amazing!  The ambient sounds option plays back your voice in the earbuds, so that you're not yelling at people next to you, you'll maintain your normal talking voice.As for the quality of sound - they're good! Nothing truly stands out here, but they have a good sound quality and there isn't too much bass/treble.Battery life is good! You'll get several hours of play time before needing to put them back in the case. Out of a full charge on the case, I can go about 2-3 days before needing to charge the case again.My advice to those that purchase - you get much more access to different options and controls if you download the Samsung Wearable app, which gives these earbuds even more appeal! Even if I didn't get these during a sale, they'd still 100% be worth the price!",Reviewed in the United States on 30 December 2023,Truly Impressive!,5.0 out of 5 stars,,2,,,samsung,,,"build quality: 2

R29PKM2YSC0ZK1,Cameron Wylie,"Good sound quality, battery life, and noise isolation for a very affordable price. It's shocking to take the headphones off and realize how loud everything is going on around you, even in a relatively quiet spot. They fit really well and comfortable in my ears, which is unusual as my ear canals are somewhat narrow. They provide multiple plugs to find the right fit for you.You have to download the Samsung wearable app to have full control over them, which is a little annoying. It took a while to make a connection and I was wondering if I would have to return them. I think restarting my phone did the trick. Galaxy s22.The touch controls are a bit annoying and limited compared to other Samsung headphones I've owned. They do not have swipe gesture to control volume. I use these while working out, so I turn off touch controls altogether to prevent changing volume or stopping my music while I'm moving around. For normal everyday use, they are probably fine for most people.Overall, for the price, hard to beat.",Reviewed in the United States on 17 November 2023,"Excellent for the price, controls are finicky",4.0 out of 5 stars,,0,,,samsung,,,"build quality: 2

R2NP1MIL4JJ5UR,jinha,"Great buds.Had so many issues with the Sennheiser CX True Wireless. Consant dropouts and having to factory reset every other week.Galaxy is so much better. Just plug and play.It might install some type of Galaxy Wearable app but you can just uninstall it. One trick is once you've paired the buds and stow they away. Turn on Phone Bluetooth then pull the buds out of the case, it'll reconnect on it's own and not have to bother with the Galaxy Wearable app screen. Or just double click back button on Android if you pair the regular way.Sound is incredible for $65, it won't knock your socks off but it surpasses it's price point. Also doesn't overwhelm you with bass like most earphones. Loud bass doesn't indicate good quality and I appreciate that Samsung agrees with that. Supposedly ANC only works when both buds are used but I've had luck on a single earbud. Pretty much can't hear noise on my left ear.Be careful using both buds on ANC when walking or crossing. It really does work well, maybe too well.Buds are comfortable even good enough for side sleepers on a firm pillow.Haven't tested the battery properly as I only use it for commute for about an hour. Usually only need to charge the case once every 10 days.  ANC will increase drain on the battery if activated.Overall really great buds for $65. Can't complain much and even the annoying app install can be removed or simply backed out by a couple presses of the back button. I've had more annoying earbuds before.

RYL1FEY7GIB9C,Micah Kimball,"I had a pair of knock-off Galaxy Buds, and the design was similar, but they had no ANC at all (even though the packaging hyped it up--it just didn't exist). The sound quality from them was barely acceptable--I didn't expect much from some cheap knock-offs.I have purchased renewed products before, and I know that sometimes it's a crap-shoot---you may get something that isn't any good.  I was willing to take that chance for some decent ear buds.When I got them, they still had a bit of charge, so I was eager to try them.  I opened up the case, and my phone (Samsung) immediately detected them and assigned them a name.  I put one in my ear and music from Spotify started playing. I got the other one in, and was immediately surprised at the depth and richness of the sound. The knock off pair didn't really have a lot of bass, but these Buds 2 really delivered (compared to the knockoffs).That's not to say that they have an amazing sound, but when you listen to Chinese fakes, the difference is staggering.Battery life is not as long as I would like--I get about 5 hours with ANC on, so it's not terrible, I just wish it was a bit longer---not that I have reason to have them in my ears for longer than that (well, except on plane rides).  The case doesn't take too long to top them off, but I haven't tested to see how many charges I can get out of the case.They are comfortable enough to sleep with them in my ears.  I have taken a few naps with them in my ears listening to some soft music and the ANC on, and have not been awakened by the neighbor's dogs--they are worth the price for that alone.I've very satisfied with this purchase.",Reviewed in the United States on 13 August 2023,Just like brand new,5.0 out of 5 stars,,23,,,samsung,,,"build quality: 2

R1LCQ19DN047II,Amazon Customer,"For some context, I'm no audiophile. I do use a set of Phillips SHP9500 at my computer though. I'll update this as time passes and I use them more.2 month update: original review remains true, but I also need to add that the battery life is awesome! Even with ANC maxed and moderate volume I still get like 4 hours of music before they die.Pros:- Immediately comfortable. I tend to sleep in my earbuds and these are low enough profile to continue doing that.- Sound isolation works... alright. Moderate conversation in the same room will occasionally make it through, but it's definitely making a difference. The noise passthrough is actually more helpful to me, as I like to be aware of what's going on. It's easy to switch between the two as well, depending on my surroundings.- Really like the case. Very tactile.Cons:Man, the sound quality is underwhelming. I've got a handful of songs I test new audio stuff on and this made each one sound *really* muddy, with the exception of vocals which are actually really crisp. When I put my computer headphones back on, it was night and day different. I get that they had to pack a lot into a really small package, but music is the *one* thing I expect these to do well, especially at the price they're asking for it.Conclusion:Its fine.

R1F5U11YIRN7MQ,Kipung Park,"Overall, I really liked it. I liked all the led signs that show enough information during the day even without smartphone's specific battery info. Sound quality is good and the noise cancellation quality is pretty good too. In a room if someone calls me when I am listening to music, I can hardly tell. So, that I really liked it.However, I wish this pair of earphones had the multiple device connection available. I mean it is a really small thing. I have paired my earphones with both laptop and my phone. Then, when I connect it to my phone, when I try to connect to my laptop, it doesn't allow both connections like higher end headphones. So, when I am already connected to my 1st device, to get connected to my 2nd device, I have to manually connect to the 2nd device, then it would disconnect from the first device and switch to the 2nd. I found this a bit uncomfortable. Like for comparison, my sony Headphone can connect two devices at the same time without disconnecting the other, so I wish it had that feature.Other than that, I found the touch sensors a bit sensitive. When I try to adjust my earphones, it would always recognize the touch and would stop the music or the video I was watching. So that is a bit uncomfortable.

R25F4IJR7B43QB,Lora Singleton,"For years I used the cheap neckband style of Bluetooth earbuds, and when I decided a while back to switch to actual earbuds, I tried at least 3 or 4 brands and styles and couldn't find ones that didn't KILL my ears. IDK if my ears are weirdly-shaped or what, but I tried TOZO NC2s and JLab Go Air Pops which both were incredibly painful. I also tried a friend's Airpods briefly and they also hurt. Finally I spotted a relative's Galaxy Buds 2 and asked to try them and the difference was incredible - these are super comfortable!The sound quality is also incredible compared to all others I've tried, and while I've never really bothered with ANC on other ones I've tried, the noise cancelling on these is certainly good enough for me. I do tend to leave it off to save the battery though, which is the main weak point of these. 5 1/2 hours or so with noise cancelling on isn't great. But I find they block enough noise for me even with it off, which makes the battery life more like 8 hours or a bit over. Even with ANC off, they block enough that I can't hear someone across the room trying to get my attention unless they're really yelling. I often use just one earbud, and I like that you can use either on its own and easily switch between them.I have a Samsung phone, which means the Galaxy Wear app lets you manage these and use the equalizer settings and such. I also love the fast pair with Samsung, where they pop up immediately asking to pair or connect, and I REALLY like the seamless pairing feature that lets me switch them instantly between my phone and my (Windows) computer without have to go into Bluetooth settings and disconnect or unpair from one to pair to the other.Overall, very happy with these. I wasn't sure how much I would really use them, so was hesitant to pay the full retail price, and the first refurbished pair I tried had one earbud that didn't work which made me wary of going that route. So this international version seemed like a nice option. I added an Asurion protection plan just in case, but so far these have worked flawlessly for several months.",Reviewed in the United States on 3 November 2022,Love them,5.0 out of 5 stars,,16,,,samsung,,,"build quality: 3

Trying to be as objective as possible, there is slightly less bass than I would have expected but plenty to have a good kick when listening to bass intensive music. Sound stage is great and you won't miss a note. The battery life is quite well, for surpassing what I was thinking and the quick recharging in the case makes it so you won't miss the music for to long while waiting for the buds to recharge. The call quality is great on my end but I will say I've been told using active noise canceling or ambient sound while on a call leave a audible noise on the other end making it hard for people to hear me.

R8ZQW2Z4EPQ3X,A,"These are the best earbuds I've used so far. I used a set of akg n400's before, but they were way too uncomfortable, fell out too easily, and battery life sucked. That could just be me and the fact I didn't have the other silicone ear triangle things. Not sure these sound as good as the n400's, but they sound very good.Sound:I like good audio, but I really don't have a great ear for judging quality. That said, these sound great to me. They sound very similiar to the AKG N400's perhaps with less bass.Fit:The buds2 fit in my ear very nicely with the included tips and I can wear them for around 9hrs without issues. They do fall out occasionall, but it's usually easy to feel when they're falling out and adjust them.Battery:The battery life on these is very impressive, as they often last 6-9hrs without charging in the case. For some reason the earbuds often drain their batteries unevenly, so you'll end up with one dead and one with 20-30% charge still. The case battery is very good and I've never ran it empty before.Case:Honestly, the case is probably my biggest issue with these earbuds. Any light drop and the case will shoot out the tiny earbuds in a 360, and then the case will close itself. This makes it really easy to lose the earbuds and not notice because the case closed itself back up.Buttons: It took me a few weeks of using the earbuds to appreciate the touch controls. Now it works fairly reliably. The app also gives you a lot of controls for the buttons.Noise Cancellation/Ambient Sound: Noise cancelling is pretty good. Not amazing but good. Some static is audible when using it. Ambient sound is okayish. It picks up on a lot of unwanted background noises like fan noise and doesn't pick up on people's speech well. Both of these features are made worse by what I talk about below.Other issues. Perhaps the most annoying issue is the earbuds have some sensor that detects if the earbud is in your ear. If it detects one earbud is not in your ear, it will disable noise cancelling or ambient sound until it detects them in your ear again. It's a great idea but it malfunctions all the time if the earbuds aren't perfectly seated in your ear. Meaning you'll be adjusting them a lot if you use noise cancelling or ambient sound. The app seriously some spyware. I've never seen any app ask for more permissions and it won't open if you deny most of them. I recommend you have some way to trick the app to deny permissions if you care about privacy. The main permissions you want to deny is location or it's ability to connect to the internet if your phone can do that, unless you need its find my earbuds ability. Otherwise the app is pretty useful and leagues better than the AKG app.",Reviewed in the United States on 1 January 2024,"Best Earbuds I've used, with some downsides",5.0 out of 5 stars,,4,,,samsung,,,"build quality: 2

The lower volumes are loud enough with ANC.The controls can be bit hit and miss sometimes, but it usually only ever takes one or two extra tries to find where to tap.The pass through feature is actually quite nice. I use it when chatting to people to save taking them out all the time. It can sound a bit robotic/tinny when it's active though, but it works well enough.Overall, I'm really happy with them.

The earbuds include 3 different size ear tips to help you find the right fit. Additionally, in the Galaxy Wearable app, there is a feature to actually test the fit. This is helpful as you can tinker and find the right earbud tip combinations for you. Prolonged sessions did result in some ear fatigue for me and I found the tips becoming a bit loose with excessive movement. I would probably not wear these to work out in. My aforementioned Galaxy Buds+ have wingtips on the top that help them remain securely in place, I find them to be a bit more comfortable than these.**Battery Life**Battery life on the Galaxy Buds 2 appear to be as advertised. For my use they are perfect as I do not wear my buds for long periods of time and am able to charge them in between sessions easily. The included charging case is easy to use and I can snap the buds in with no issues. Again, the Galaxy Buds+ were a bit better in this regard with the battery lasting around 9 hours on one charge, but they also did not have Active Noise Cancellation which consumes a good amount of battery life.**Connectivity**Using a Galaxy phone makes connecting these headphones a breeze! It was a simple as opening the case. Seriously, once I did that my phone recognized it and had a popup to pair. Connecting them to my tablet (S8) was not as easy. I had to put the earbuds into pairing mode and open my Galaxy Wearable app on the  tablet and connect that way. Once set up, it is very easy to reconnect. I also was able to pair with my Chromecast for late night TV viewing without waking up my wife.**Audio**This is where this set of earbuds earns its keep in my opinion. I am by NO MEANS an audiophile but the audio quality coming from the Buds+ was night and day for me. Music, TV, and calls all sound clear and crisp with a decent amount of bass without virtually 0 static. The ambient noise and active noise cancellation features work as intended and the 360 audio is a very cool feature to add a level of immersion, especially when watching movies.**Conclusion**This is a solid set of earbuds and at the current price point, makes a ton of sense in my opinion. I am very pleased with this set and will continue to use them as my ""daily driver"" earbuds.",Reviewed in the United States on 17 April 2023,"Samsung strikes again!

R1YB8ELEYXY6U6,Parmesh Chopra,"IN BRIEF - if you can afford it, excellent balanced sound (no bass heavy stuff), best noise cancellation in all earphones, best fitting earphones in the world. Marvelous for gym also as they're sweat resistant. Mic only on right earbud seems a drawback. Bose music app is very basic. No equalizer offered too.Bought these before Diwali after a lot of research. Absolutely loved them. I use them while taking long walks or editing videos while attending a workshop simultaneously.THE MOST USEFUL FEATUREThe microphone embedded on the right earbud is unbelievably powerful. It cancels external noise during phone calls and focuses only on your voice. And all this while just being a tiny insertion in your ear. Remarkable. Almost hard to believe at first.COMFORT AND FITBose gives you three tip sizes to adjust on the eaebubds before you start using them. Finding  right tip is not optional. It is compulsory if you wish to experience active noise cancellation. Please note that once you get your ear tip size right, noise cancellation feature comes into play only then. And the noise cancellation is very very powerful. It is the best among the rest.ONCE IT FITS, IT WON'T COME OUT OF EARI jog, I run, I jump. My earbuds remain intact inside my ears. Grip is unbelievably firm. The lever fits so well in the ear. No chance of it popping out anytime. But please note you have to find your correct ear tip size before comfort and fit points stated by me become true for you.THE GOOD ABOUT THESEThe best feature in these as per my usage and observation is their ability to make your voice heard to the listener on a phone call in a noisy environment. So in my case I walk along traffic on a busy road in Gurgaon. But when I call using the earbuds, it is silky smooth. I hear the audio of the person at  the other end as swiftly as they hear mine. I double check with everyone when starting a call in traffic and they all have said they don't think I'm in traffic at all as my voice goes through super clear even after noise reduction. Excellent technology.Another great feature is double tap on earbuds to pick call without having the need to touch smartphone. And automatic playing of a YouTube video after a call in case you were watching before.Yet another remarkable feature, if not the most powerful one among all competitors - best noise cancellation for earbuds. Their noise cancellation and audio output gives a run for money to a full size over ear headphones. The overall experience is outstanding.THE NOT SO GOODBass lovers might be disappointed. The audio print of these earphones is neutral. They deliver naturally sounding crisp audio. No treble heavy or bass heavy.THE BADMicrophone is embedded only on right earbud. So if you wish to wear only left one, you can't take calls.You can't keep right earbud inside the case and insert only left earbud in your ear to listen to music. The right earbud has to be taken out of the case and kept outside if you only wish to use the left one.Prolonged usage might cause burning sensation in ear.",Reviewed in India on 12 December 2020,"The most comfortable, phone call making earbuds of 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/916WsYFC9NL.jpg

RE3C941TXD7SB,Rohit matte,"I recently purchased a pair of earphones that turned out to be a complete disappointment. Not only did they fail to meet my expectations, but they were also a complete waste of my hard-earned money. Here's why I believe these earphones deserve such a poor review:Terrible Sound Quality: The most crucial aspect of any earphones is their sound quality, and these earphones failed miserably in that department. The audio was muffled, lacking clarity, and the bass was virtually nonexistent. I couldn't enjoy my music or podcasts with these earphones, as the sound was so poor it was borderline unbearable.Flimsy Build Quality: Right out of the box, I could tell these earphones were poorly constructed. The plastic used in their construction felt cheap and fragile. Within a few days of use, one of the earpieces started to crack, and eventually, it completely fell apart. It's clear that no attention was given to durability during the manufacturing process.Uncomfortable Fit: The design of these earphones is incredibly uncomfortable. They did not come with different-sized ear tips, so I was stuck with a one-size-fits-all solution that didn't fit my ears properly. I couldn't wear them for more than a few minutes without experiencing discomfort and pain.Terrible Noise Isolation: I expected these earphones to provide at least some level of noise isolation, but they failed to do so. I could hear external noises clearly, which completely defeated the purpose of using earphones. It was frustrating to have to raise the volume to drown out background sounds, further exacerbating the poor sound quality.Inadequate Customer Support: When I contacted customer support to express my concerns and request a refund or replacement, I was met with indifference. The representative seemed disinterested and unhelpful, providing no satisfactory resolution to my problem. It was an incredibly frustrating experience that left a sour taste in my mouth.Overall, I regret purchasing these earphones. They are a prime example of poor quality and lackluster performance. I would strongly advise against wasting your money on this product. Look elsewhere for earphones that offer better sound quality, durability, and customer support",Reviewed in India on 4 June 2023,Product is faulty,1.0 out of 5 stars,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oV2+3g-eL.jpg,2,Triple Black,,bose,,,"build quality: 1

R295V6GFLOTZQ2,Placeholder,"Being a Bose fan bought it.Has same quality that you expect from a Bose product.In terms of sound quality, which is the primary reason for buying a new earbud, it‚Äôs more or less same sound quality like Sound sports free. No plus stars there!Wireless charging is a plus.Sleeker look is a plus.Touch controls is a plus.A big blunder - You can‚Äôt control volume from the earbud, you have to do it through the connected source device. Why would Bose forget a volume control on the earbuds! It‚Äôs a touch control enabled earbud so some gestures in the earbuds could have been enabled to control volume as well - sadly that‚Äôs missing!More or less all the pluses are software driven.One major drawback in the earbuds is that unless you pump up the volume to beyond 80% the output of volume is abysmal.Most of bass and depth is only heard when you pump up the volume to 80% or above.Voice assistant on IPhone is only confined to Siri and doesn‚Äôt have options for Google or Alexa yet.Equalizer settings are missing too.Needs more software upgrades to incorporate these missing features.If sound quality is the only criteria then last Bose earbuds are as good and these can be skipped.Of course if you want the touch and wireless charging then go for these.Software seems to need several more upgrades to incorporate the missing features.",Reviewed in India on 17 October 2020,Software Driven Upgrade - Not Really Bang For Buck!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Dh0UxTyfL.jpg

Gets connected to the device without any lag. One time- One device, but that's really ok. can switch from 1 device to another easily using Bose Music app.3. Touch controls are super sharp. No lag and No false command.4. Company says battery lasts for 6hrs on ANC and the case gives 12hrs of extra charge so total 18hrs. But this is a false comment from company. The earbuds last 8+hrs on a single charge and case gives 15+ hrs of extra charge. Its been 11 days since i bought, i charged on the 1st day of arrival, and today after 11 days, there were 2 points left in the case that means another 40% still left. I don't think any other earbuds may last longer than this.5.  Noise cancellation is as expected.6. Just found 1 issue with the wireless charging. I dont think Magsafe charger(Apple) works on it. As soon as i placed the case on the magsafe, it started charging, but even after 2hrs, no progress.while on normal type c charger, it gets charged within 2hrs.7. Size dosen't really matter to me, so the big case(Twice as compared to apple airpods pro) isn't a issue for me. even the out of the earbuds isn't an issue for me as compared to airpods.8. Bose music app takes care of the software upgrades on background. So no need to manually check.9. I not a music enthusiast, I bought this for my business meetings and calls, sometimes movies. It perform great on that.10. Tried some high bass and beats music to test the performance. Thrilled for an earbuds to perfrom like these.11. Don't compare any earbuds with headphones. Obviously they will be better in noise cancellation, sound quality but compare among the earbuds product only.12. I have Airpods pro too, Bose easily defeated Airpods pro in every aspect- i told size doesn't matter to me13. I watched some 100 videos on youtube before buying this product. So got a clear picture of what i was going to buy. Every video has compared bose with Airpods pro.14. Obviously overpriced, but what if they lasts longer than airpods pro?

R2EOOOBCTKTDLH,Placeholder,"Update after 2 yrs:After getting the first faulty device replaced since it was under warranty, the second device again stopped working after 2 yrs. There was no physical damage. The earbuds simply get disconnected from bluetooth when i pick them out from the case. This time when I visited the service center, they said they can't do any repairs beyond software upgrade. The only thing Bose service center offered was 10% off if I upgrade to quietcomfort 2 :)Needless to say, I am never buying Bose againAfter 1 month of purchase:i had a horrible experience which seems to be quite commonplace with Bose these days. I am saying this because 3 of my other friends also had a similar experience in past 6 months with bose earbuds. For me, the left earbud suddenly stopped working just 8 days after the purchase and then began my tiresome journey to get adequate support. Mind you, there was no physical damage; it just stopped working after i took it out from the case on the 8th day.  I tried all the troubleshooting steps started on bose website but nothing worked. Called Amazon but they refused to provide any help on this as their replacement policy is valid for only 7 days. I also contacted the bose flagship store in Bangalore but they stated that they can replace it immediately only if the product was purchased from a physical store. The store representative even chided me for purchasing it on amazon and said that such problems are bound to occur if purchased online. This took me by complete surprise as i never expected a big brand like Bose to have such different standards in product and support quality for offline and online channels.Lastly, after nth attempt to conact Bose' customer support, i was given the address of a 3p service center. Upon visiting that service center, it took over an hour for them to try some software updates etc and then finally they declared that the piece is faulty and would need to be replaced. However, this only service center in Bangalore didn't even have a single replacement unit of this device which is one of fastest selling sku of Bose. Now i have been told that i need to wait for 10 days for the stock to arrive and then they will replace it. Moreover, neither the Bose customer care helpline nor the phone number of the 3p service center is picking up my calls to inform me the status of ordered replacement stock. There is absolutely no tracking provided. I guess they expect me to keep visiting the service center once every 2-3 days to check for the status.",Reviewed in India on 14 October 2021,Horrible experience....Left earbud stopped working in a week,1.0 out of 5 stars,,16,Soapstone,,bose,,,"build quality: 1

It can beat it's competitors hands down.But it struggles to cancel noice during calls and ends up picking more noice than it should. As a Bose users you will not have issues but people on the other end of the line WILL COMPLAIN.This does not connect to multiple devices at the same time, if that's what you're looking for.This is a pure multimedia earphone!

R20CZMPRURLXIV,Sanjay Kumar Sena,"Awesome sound quality and ANC. The sound quality depends upon the device you are connecting and the app you are using. Earlier I was using jiosaavn but the sound quality was not so impressive. Then I tried spotify and there was big difference. Spotify combined with Moto audio gave an amazing sound quality. Bass, treble everything is balanced. This might disappoint heavy bass lovers. To check the sound quality you can play the tracks - Surface by Aero Chord, Animals, silent shout, drover, tsunami etc. It supports AAC and SBC codec and not aptX.As far as touch controls are concerned, you can skip to next track by touching and holding the left earbud. This shortcut needs to be enabled from the bose music app. Double tap the left earbud to switch to 3 different ANC levels, also these 3 levels can be set through the app. Swipe up the right earbud to increase the volume or swipe down to decrease the volume, again this control needs to be turned on through the bose music app. Double tap the right earbud to pause/play tracks or receive/disconnect calls. Touch and hold the right earbud to decline a call or activate your phone's voice assistant.In terms of connectivity, it pairs very fast and range is also good.For the users like me battery backup is also good. I use it almost 2-3 hours every day and in last 11 days I have charged it for just once.Looks and build quality of other competitors might be quite good but for me the sole purpose of a earphone is to deliver High quality sound and this requirement is faithfully served by these buds.",Reviewed in India on 4 June 2021,Rediscover Music,5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B17YTwoSJRS.jpg

R1T6WYKI1PLIIF,Ashwin,"It's obviously the beast. The sound is thunderous, there's no doubt about it. The beats are very very clear and the bass is appropriate, neither too much nor too less, just the right amount. Noise cancellation is also superb. Obviously you can't compare it with any headphones specifically bose nc 700 or Sony WH-1000XM4,but in comparison of any earphone available in the market by far, its the best. Sound quality is also very fine. Each and every tune, beats etc are clear. Battery life is also good. Bose say 6 hrs and more or else it is true. Many things depends upon your usage, sound level, nc on or off, using for listening music or calling etc etc. Battery life will depend on that. Just I have a little problem or say it more as a disappointment that it is not as comfortable as bose soundsport truly wireless, though it is far more comfortable with bose sports earbuds, which I personally am not able to use it for more than 2 hrs atmost after that the ear starts hurting a lot. It is far far better than that, but since I have a soundsport truly wireless and I am using it since last 2.5 years so I know it is the best if you will compare the comfort level.Overall very happy with the product.

Now they're working. They're a little bit uncomfortable in the ear. And I observed a little lag. And the mic is not very sensitive so I must speak loud. Plus sometimes on a call it tries to cancel out not just my noise but also on the other person's end which is irritating because white noise keeps appearing when the cancellation fails, eg when the person speaks.

R3HQ9NJFWVJR1S,Dinesh Shenoi P,"The Bose Earbuds purchased first in Oct 2021 developed issues on the left ear bud after use of just 8 months. When I raised a compliant with Bose via Amazon, they replaced it with a new one in Aug 2022 as this was within the warranty period of 1 year. However the replacement new one that I received developed a similar issue with the left ear bud and not able to use it. After going through the reviews of Bose in other sites, I understand that this seems to be a common problem with Bose earbuds. But for the expensive buds that we purchase it for, Bose should by default give at least a 2 year warrants to justify the high cost that it charges. Now I am hesitant to purchase Bose buds again for fear of this issue.",Reviewed in India on 18 February 2023,Bose left ear bud not working,2.0 out of 5 stars,,0,Triple Black,,bose,,,"build quality: 1

R3DZJTMZ2R151R,Saurabh Vashist,"Received the earbuds today and I have been using them for a day and so far so good (actually excellent!). Let me start with the Good.1) Extremely good Active Noise Cancellation: You can precisely control the level of noise cancellation with the Bose App.2) Perfect fit for the ears (if you try all combinations!): Bose has suggested to try out all sorts of permutations and combinations on the various sizes provided (1-3). To my surprise, in my right ear, size 1 fit perfectly - while in my left ear, size 2 earbud was a better fit.3) No displacement: Once this was sorted, I went for a run and did a intense HIIT workout, did a couple of work calls and all this without once feeling that they might fall off.4) Battery life: While Bose claims a battery life of 6 hours, I have been using them for the last 8 hours straight.Cons:1) Some might find it bulky and heavy. Depends on whether you prefer better ANC vs better design (AirPods Pro are for you then).2) Can only connect with one device at a time. Serious drawback, I hope they fix this via an update.",Reviewed in India on 15 October 2020,"Excellent ANC, some might it bulky, fits perfectly for me",5.0 out of 5 stars,,49,Triple Black,,bose,,,"build quality: 3

There is a official page on Bose website, asking users to follow troubleshooting steps for resolution,  and if its not fixed, they are asking to visit the service centre. Go and check yourself on Google once.

A year later I purchased it from Croma where it was on an offer. I ignored the bulkiness, and the rather cheap build quality of the case and decided to put my money on the sound quality. Sadly, within 14 hours of purchase, one of the earbuds just stopped working. I had a very difficult time getting a refund on the product from Croma. Long story short, here's what you need to consider:1- If you are looking at ease of connectivity and reliability, and if you are on iOS, go for the Airpods Pro2- If it's an android that you are having, check out the Galaxy buds pro. They are simply awesome at the price point.3- But if you're willing to take a chance, then go for this4- If you don't want any of the well-known leading brands, you may want to consider the Momentum 3 TWSHope this helps.",Reviewed in India on 6 June 2022,Very unreliable performance,2.0 out of 5 stars,,7,Triple Black,,bose,,,"build quality: 1

R9JR3UT37IYFN,saunakb,"I am a Bose fan since ages. I still use their qc 25 wired earphones in this WFH age. Needed a Bluetooth option to complement. Was thrilled to find this product on deal. Glitchy set up and clunky app required turning off all other Bluetooths nearby. Post set up, ANC, soundstage and clarity was amazing. Left earprice simply stopped working in 2 days. Tried a bunch of fixes from Bose website and the internet. Nothing worked and it seemed that the left earpiece battery is dead. Ordered a replacement which arrived promptly. Setup this time was easier since going to a middle of a park avoided all other Bluetooth signals. Again was blown away by the sound and ANC quality. Right earpiece decided to quit audio in 3 days, and the left one tagged along with it. Not the earprice battery this time but seems to be glitchly signal from right to left earpiece stopping all audio from both earpieces if used together. Left earpiece works fine if used alone after reformatting all connections, but the moment you take the right earpiece out of the box, it's game over. No way do a factory reset to get rid of glitchy updates if that's the issue or to take another walk to the park to re-ignite our pairing. Heartbroken with Bose's inablility to launch a reliable pair of earbuds which doesn't ghost you if you look at them side ways. Requested a return now and have purchased a competitor product.

R18HAK37F7YE8Z,Arvind Prasad,"Most of the reviews written here are right after receiving the earbuds. This is a long term a true review. Immediately after I received the earbuds, it was not working. It was replaced the next day thanks to amazon.After 11 months of use the left earbud failed. I contacted support. It was a harrowing experience. The guys seem to be least interested in solving the issue and kept sending me manuals on how to connect earbuds. They later asked me to return the earbuds to Klick IT solutions, their partner in customer support. It was returned on Feb 03,2023. It should be noted that service for this product is provided by TVS India. They act and respond like pigeon messengers of BOSE. BOSE India has not put up their office phone numbers or emails on website. Therefore they are not answerable to customers!!!!!!! Call center has the standard reply, ""When we receive it we will replace it"". I have never experience such poor service after paying high cost.

R3HATFE02T9G0R,Siddharth Tata,"Edited review- written Nov-2023Was using this product with good experience for past 13 months. One fine day the left earbud stopped working (red and white light flashing). Called service Center to find out that this product cannot be repaired and was offered a 10 percent discount if I buy a new one as warranty is for 12 months only. Just outraged at the fact that a product from a brand like Bose can stop working a month after warranty and there is no remedy. Willing to pay service pays to fix it- but they say they can‚Äôt do anything about it. Internet has a lot of similar reviews of product just failing suddenly. Don‚Äôt buy this until you are confident that Bose has fixed the defect or are willing to live with a piece of junk immediately after 1 year.Original review- written Sep-2022First the positives- the Bose noise cancelling is the boss of the industry. I have about 10 Bose products at home and the one thing that always delights is the sound quality. The not so great parts- the buds are large and come in a large case- Bose needs to fix this on their next generation.Now the very bad part. The earbuds worked great and I was using it for 1-2 days and they ran out of charge (as they should) but they wouldn‚Äôt recharge. Tried every trouble shooting step listed on the website but didn‚Äôt work. Of course buying Bose from Amazon means you have two super customer obsessed companies and Amazon customer service offered a replacement next day. I am on my second set, so far things seem to be working fine.",Reviewed in India on 29 September 2022,Edited after 13 months- DONT BUY THIS- It doesn‚Äôt last long,1.0 out of 5 stars,,46,Triple Black,,bose,,,"build quality: 0

R3E3MV327DY0VQ,Kavish Dani,"I used one plus buds previously and i was not happy with the product as it gave pain in my ears after some use.Well coming to nord 2 buds i was skeptical whether to buy or not. But let me tell you i am totally satisfied with the product this time.Case is very strong the hinge is of superb qualtiy if you shake it the upper part will not shake a little so good built qualtiy and good pairing response. One plus devices will have advantage of auto connect and it doesn't need pairing process to be followed where as for other device you have to download app helomelody for changing the function of buds.Coming to the buds. 5 star voice quality and bass is superb. The fit is so soft and it feels very light in ears. I tried riding bike at 100 while wearing it no issues it was in the place properly also tried shaking the head and running no issues. Buds can be controlled via app helomelody and one plus device have the software built in.Check the app screenshots. First is anc control. You will feel the difference when switching it from anc, off and transparent. You can listen how it will feel when you listen music or speak on call in transparent mode. You can feel the difference awesome feature. Anc will take more battery please note.Sound master let's you select equaliser and increse the bass wave.Game mode is for reducing latency while gaming.Earbud control. You can select 6 functions 3 each buds and that's an upgrade from one plus buds. There is single, double and triple tap. I have keptRight bud double tap next song/take calls, triple tap for previous trackLeft bud double tap voice assistant, 3 nonesingle tap for play for both right and left bud.Touch and hold for changing the anc mode or transparency mode.It also has tap feedback feature means when you tap he word it makes a click sound so that you can know how many times you have tapped the buds. So while you tap it thrice and hear two click sounds that means you have tapped twice and buds will respond to the function assigned to 2 taps.The best feature i found out is device switching. If your buds is paired with multiple devices then you can switch device by tap and hold for 3 secs it will connect to other device easily. I have tried in 2 phones haven't checked for more than 2 device or laptop.Overall it's  worth to buy this buds not to forget all these features on reasonable price. I loved it. It's far better than the one plus buds. Nice work one plus...If you are confused between buds nord and buds nord 2 there is a difference if bluetooth version and drivers that's it.Best and within budget...Edit: while driving the other person will hear lots of noise and speaking on call while driving a 2 wheeler is not at all possible, be aware of that I tried every modes but it just doesn't help.",Reviewed in India on 25 June 2023,Flawless ear buds.

R3KZ33F03CZR92,Raj Kriti Sinha,"Ordered during Great Indian Festival.Effective price after SBI Discount was Rs. 2250/-I ordered this product after thorough research.And I am happy that for this price, it exceeds my expectations.Design - Similar to Nord Buds the first. But, both the gray and white colors have some faint dotted design over the case and the stem of the buds. Faint flue dots over white. I was not prepared for that, at first glance, it looks a little dusty but can be overlooked.Both the case and buds are very lightweight and easy to carry.However, what I found to be a downside is that the buds dont have any magnetic attraction between them, so while they're easy to place in the case, outside the case they can't be clubbed together.Fit - Fits perfectly. No pain/discomfort. When I move my head from side to side, they stay put. I ran on the treadmill for a few minutes at 12kmph. They didn‚Äôt even budge. It didn‚Äôt feel like they would slip out. Which is great.Call Quality - The thing I was most worried about. And it passes the test. I live on a quiet street though - The other person is able to hear me loud and clear, and sometimes, ambient sound is also audible to them but the volume of that sound is much lower than my voice so it is not bothersome. Even in busier surroundings, no one has complained about my call quality yet!Audio Quality - I'm quite fond of listening to loud music. This does more than just justice to the loudness. I am more than happy listening at 50% volume. It‚Äôs definitely bass heavy. The quality of the sound is clear and crisp. I am very happy.ANC - It was not a priority for me, however, I did try it. Noise cancellation is definitely very effective. It does as much as promised, not more. However, there is a faint hissing sound. But it doesn‚Äôt bother me when playing some music or audio.Hey Melody - Its NOT detecting my earbuds yet lol. I'm an apple user. Let's see I'll try pairing it properly.Switching between devices - Unpair with one to pair with another. Not much of a hassle though, its fairly quick. And it automatically pairs with my phone as soon as I take it out of the case.Battery Life - Yet to be explored! I‚Äôm someone who carries all my chargers on the go and tend to keep all my devices well charged, so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to face much issue.My Personal Reasons why I didn't go for Buds Z2 even though my budget was flexible -1. In Ear Detection - if it goes haywire, I don't think there's an option to turn it off.2. Glossy finish - I was afraid it would slip out.3. It was released in 2021. About time we got a Z3, no?Reasons why I wanted Z2 -1. 3 mics2. Google pairing - easy switch between devices3.

As the drivers are 12.5mm u cannot hear in the full sound for sure. But if u do hear it then u are either u born with super powers or deaf.Build - 5/5 - overall build quality is excellent. i have dropped the buds  4 times  already, but still it is like a new onecomfort - 5/5 - i personally liked the design and it's really comfortable for me after wearing the buds.overall it is a value for money for this price range. highly recommended.",Reviewed in India on 10 December 2023,value for money buds,4.0 out of 5 stars,,4,Thunder Grey,Nord Buds 2,oneplus,,Extra Large,"build quality: 5

R3IUQPMYEIDRA5,Ashokprabu K,"Design:Good buds, not easily fall from the ears. But the box is not comfortable at jeans pocket, need to be a little comfortable design to keep in pockets.Quality:The quality of the material is really good, Sound quality is good, I cannot say its extraordinary because unable to make a tight push into the ears there is a air gap always, but still the ANC reduces the outside noise good and able to manage and listen the good quality sound.Connectivity:only 6 to 8 meters for a good reception. beyond this will get frequent disconnection. The 6-8 meters also should not have any hurdles then only it will be. While open the box lid it connects to the device a bit annoying, should get connect only when we pick the buds from the box, since there is a magnetic touch given or the buds it should have been handled in that way.Paring:Paring button is on the box near to the charging port, which is really good. should be a little quick responsive for the touch, some times it responses quick some times it did not response for the touch may be its due to the design texture on the touch area.Battery:30 to 40 percent consumption for a 2 hour continuous usage with ANC. Which is quit disappointment, but still it will get charged once we put the buds into the box which is a good thing. Should have to improve the battery consumption a little smarter way. Each buds took different level of consumption I guess this is  due to more touch on one buds.Convenient :For one plus mobile there a dedicated menu given in the Bluetooth setting, to control over the earphone and able to customize the touch controls. may be the touch area can be kept little down to give a good convenience to put the earphone a good push to ears. because when we try to tight the earphones the touch responses which is annoying.",Reviewed in India on 25 October 2023,Acceptable ANC Good Sound,5.0 out of 5 stars,,7,Thunder Grey,Nord Buds 2,oneplus,,Extra Large,"build quality: 2

R3QHMYULCL2NZ4,KRISHTIFFER,"Pros:The OnePlus Nord Buds 2 impresses with amazing bass, sound quality, and user-friendly app control. The battery backup is commendable, and the ""find your buds"" feature adds convenience. The ANC functionality, with three modes, enhances the overall listening experience. Mic is also good for calls.Cons:The only drawback is the occasionally frustrating touch controls, often misinterpreting taps.Overall:OnePlus Nord Buds 2 stand out in the market with premium sound quality and features. While the touch control issue deducts a star, the product's overall excellence and OnePlus's reliable after-sales service make it a top choice in its category. It sets a high standard for competitors to prioritize product improvement over marketing.",Reviewed in India on 19 November 2023,"Exceptional Sound, But Touch Controls Fall Short",4.0 out of 5 stars,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qsU38TqsL.jpg,5,Lightning White,Nord Buds 2,oneplus,,Extra Large,"build quality: 2

R2C5RUKPNVA6AC,Arjun,"It's been a year since my purchase and I am very happy with these mini boom boxes. It does live up to its name of the basswave technology. However, it's best not to be meddled with in terms of the Equalizer. The default setting is perfect. The earphones are durable and so is the case. Backup after full charge is about 5 hours on continuous use and goes up to 15 hours on intermittent use. The only concern overtime is to make sure you clean the mesh every 4 months to keep the sound from getting blocked out. The ANC is not great but works decently well for the price you pay. Bluetooth range is pretty good, goes upto 7 to 8 meters without glitching.The only drawback would be that they don't hold onto your ear like you'd want them to. If you prefer wearing the smallest buds, you'll have a hard time during sweaty summers as the earbuds will slip off quite often when you workout/run etc.Otherwise, a brilliant, value for money product by OnePlus.",Reviewed in India on 22 December 2023,Excellent quality for asking price,5.0 out of 5 stars,,0,Thunder Grey,Nord Buds 2,oneplus,,Extra Large,"build quality: 3

R3TNEFUSEGDCUA,Devilking,"The OnePlus Nord Buds 2 are a pair of affordable true wireless earbuds that offer good sound quality, active noise cancellation (ANC), and a comfortable fit. They are a modest upgrade over their predecessor, the OnePlus Nord Buds, but they are still a good value for the price.**Sound quality**The OnePlus Nord Buds 2 have a balanced sound profile with good bass, mids, and highs. The bass is punchy and impactful, but it doesn't overwhelm the other frequencies. The mids are clear and detailed, and the highs are crisp and extended.The Nord Buds 2 also support Dolby Atmos, which can provide a more immersive listening experience for certain types of content. However, Dolby Atmos is not available on all streaming platforms, and it is not compatible with all types of audio files.**Active noise cancellation**The OnePlus Nord Buds 2 have active noise cancellation (ANC), which can help to reduce ambient noise. The ANC is not as effective as on more expensive earbuds, but it does a decent job of blocking out low-frequency noises, such as the hum of an airplane or the rumble of a bus.**Fit and comfort**The OnePlus Nord Buds 2 are comfortable to wear for long periods of time. They are lightweight and have a secure fit. The earbuds come with three different sizes of ear tips, so you can find the perfect fit for your ears.**Battery life**The OnePlus Nord Buds 2 have a battery life of up to 30 hours on a single charge (with ANC turned off). With ANC turned on, the battery life is reduced to around 24 hours. The charging case provides an additional 30 hours of battery life.**Overall**The OnePlus Nord Buds 2 are a good pair of affordable true wireless earbuds.

If you are looking for a budget-friendly pair of earbuds with ANC, the Nord Buds 2 are a good option to consider.**Pros:*** Good sound quality* Active noise cancellation* Comfortable fit* Affordable price**Cons:*** ANC is not as effective as on more expensive earbuds* Dolby Atmos is not available on all streaming platforms and is not compatible with all types of audio files**Who should buy the OnePlus Nord Buds 2?**The OnePlus Nord Buds 2 are a good choice for people who are looking for a pair of affordable true wireless earbuds with good sound quality and active noise cancellation.

R1KFONDZFEC71J,Padmam,"After 3 years of extremely rough use knockoff Chinese wireless Bluetooth earbud kicked the bucket. Earbud, because one of them still work(and people say Chinese tech is poorly made). At the time of buying those knockoff earbuds it was around the same price as these One Plus Nord Buds 2 price range, actually I believe it was slightly cheaper(I cannot for the life of me remember). I am not a heavy earbuds user, I mostly use it to listen to podcasts in the morning and pair it with my laptop to listen to music while I work at night. The buds seldom leave the vicinity of my work desk at home, no exposure to the elements of nature and no exposure to sweat. I clean my earbuds regularly. That being said I do listen to a wide range of music, I'm no audiophile, but can identify change in quality in the listening device.With that in mind, these earbuds offer an okay sound quality, hence why I gave it 4 stars, the sound quality is clear and don't have much noise, the trebles are well balanced so as to not rupture your eardrums, but the bass is overblown which is why I gave it 3 stars. The bass drowns out the other sounds, and overwhelms your ear. Especially if you are listening to an orchestral piece, you'll struggle appreciate the individual artists. This can be solved with software to a certain extent. By using the ""HeyMelody"" app you can configure your OnePlus Nord Buds 2. You can use pre configured sound profiles like Balanced, Bold, Serenade, or Bass. There is also the BassWave option which allows you to adjust the clarity and fidelity of the bass via software. If you are still unsatisfied you can configure your own custom profile by adding an equalizer and creating the ideal audio setup.Now one of the more attractive feature of these buds I have seen from other buyers is the ANC at this price point. Honestly I don't really use the feature that much, mostly because I like to be aware of my surroundings and not get completely immersed in whatever I'm doing on the computer/phone. But the ANC works kinda well? I mean it's not the same as Apple's ANC, but for 3k you should temper your expectations. By holding down on the touch gesture surface on the ear buds or by going into the app on your phone you can enable ANC. It was able to completely tune out the ambient buzzing sound of my Air Conditioning, which is old and loud, so I think the ANC is very good. The only thing is when there is no audio playing you'll hear a hissing or buzzing sound if you have ANC enabled. It's not super annoying, but that is just my personal opinion.As for battery backup, I have managed to go 2 days without charging the buds, but this is with light usage. It still has 90% left even after I have used it for 2 days so I think the battery backup is good. The case is sturdy and the buds fall into place within the case magnetically. Bluetooth connectivity is seamless and that's all I have to say about the buds.I have however talked to people that bought these buds as a part of expanding their OnePlus ecosystem, and they claim that these buds are amazing when paired with their OnePlus phone or OnePlus tablet. I wouldn't know, I don't believe in ecosystems.But people, for 3k this is totally worth the price. Haven't met with any issues till now, if I do I'll make sure to update this review.

I have been using them for 2 days now and they feel pretty good.Design1. Premium design, with metallic case and buds too.2. TWS Snaps into place quickly, with really strong magnets.3. Also the metallic design has specs of white color marks on the case (for Thunder Grey). I mistook this for dust and tried to rub it off üòÇ.4. Cons: I found the cable a little short for charging, but its okay since I have my own Type-C charger anyway5. CONS: At this price range, I would expect a volume control on the buds, given the customization possible through the app.App1. The app is also good but not great. It has a host of options from customizing your buds to specific task. I found in the app store, people are complaining there isn't any equalizer, but actually there is.2. Find my buds feature is also cool (atleast they tried at this price range. Do not compare to air pods or samsung buds)3. CONS: Like I said the App is well thought off both UI & UX wise, but from a developers (myself) standpoint - there is still room for improvement.Connectivity1. I use a Samsung phone, but the guide is pretty clear on how to do so. My Bluetooth almost caught them and paired immediately.2. Auto wake up pairing is also working with the last device provided the device Bluetooth still on. If not the bud switches to the device before it. If none of these are found, then it is just idle, and you need to turn on some devices Bluetooth.3. Device switching: Configured through the app, the feature is actually great.Sound:1. I find it has a good bass, but I am not a sound guy.2. The app has many enhances & equalizers which enhance the sound quality.Modes:1. ANC - The 25db works for traffic and underground metro perspective (2 things I tested). It also works well if you are trying to ignore your family always talking.2. The game mode reduces considerable lag.3. The environment mode (forgot name) - which gives us ambient noise is also cool when walking on a street.4. CONS: A jingle plays on going from one mode to another. So many jingles confuse me. I would prefer a person saying like ""ANC"" or ""Game Mode"" etc.Navigation (Touch Button):The multi-functional touch button on the buds is great and responsive. Again, I would like a ""sound notification"" instead of a jingle, but thats my preference. Otherwise call pickup, drop, next, prev, assistant, switching modes, switching devices are all excellent.Overall, I would say it's a great bud to go for at the given price range of something around 2.5K. Anything greater wait for it to drop.",Reviewed in India on 6 January 2024,"If you can, buy it",5.0 out of 5 stars,,6,Thunder Grey,Nord Buds 2,oneplus,,Extra Large,"build quality: 2

R3D1JSTULS8NNH,Saurabh Kundu,"I'm so happy with my OnePlus Nord Buds 2 TWS in Ear Earbuds! They are small and comfortable to wear, and they have a good bass that makes my music sound awesome. The only minor issue is that there is some slight distortion in the sound when I turn the volume to the max, but I don't do that often anyway. The battery life is amazing, it lasts me the whole day of usage without needing to charge. The ANC feature is good too, it blocks out most of the noise around me, but it feels a bit cheap compared to other brands. Overall, I think these earbuds are great and worth the price.",Reviewed in India on 10 November 2023,ALL GOOD,4.0 out of 5 stars,,27,Lightning White,Nord Buds 2,oneplus,,Extra Large,"build quality: 2

RU73STR04PPE2,sazeer,I bought this product recently. Used it full-fledged for about 10 days. I am using this product with realme gt2 pro.Lets talk about cons first1. Ear comfort of this product is ok but not  great. Using more than 1 hr ear  starts to hurt and painful. You need to  remove buds from ear and then keep  again to tackle the pain. I tried other ear  tips which comes in the box. tried small  ear tips which made comfort even worse  and painful.2 when audio is paused you will hear some  kind of gizzz sound which is very  annoying may be it is to handle outside  sound it seems. In transparency mode  gizz sound is less as you will hear outside  noise. When your not playing anything  keep buds aside or in the box donot  keep in ears. Trust me you will definitely  feel discomfort.3 ANC - Active Noise Cancellation is  working good but not great. You can still  hear outside noises. But it does have  difference. 50 percent of noises will be  reduced but not complete isolation.4 Hey Melody App. when phone bluetooth  is on buds will automatically pairs which  is great but when you go into app it still  shows select device to connect. But from  bluetooth settings i am able to select  and configure the product. I feel if device  is connected app should atleast show it  is connected.Pros 1. Sound Quality is great. 2. Bass is great. 3. Switching with between multiple device  is great as it wont automatically shift to  other device and you have to touch and  hold long to  shift and continue using. It  can be configure from app. 4. Battery backup is good. 5. Having ANC in this price is great. 6. Ear fitting is great. It wont fall from the  ear.Hope this review helps..!!,Reviewed in India on 20 May 2023,Worth the price,4.0 out of 5 stars,,502,Thunder Grey,Nord Buds 2,oneplus,,Extra Large,"build quality: 2
