"R3E3MV327DY0VQ","Kavish Dani","I used one plus buds previously and i was not happy with the product as it gave pain in my ears after some use.Well coming to nord 2 buds i was skeptical whether to buy or not. But let me tell you i am totally satisfied with the product this time.Case is very strong the hinge is of superb qualtiy if you shake it the upper part will not shake a little so good built qualtiy and good pairing response. One plus devices will have advantage of auto connect and it doesn't need pairing process to be followed where as for other device you have to download app helomelody for changing the function of buds.Coming to the buds. 5 star voice quality and bass is superb. The fit is so soft and it feels very light in ears. I tried riding bike at 100 while wearing it no issues it was in the place properly also tried shaking the head and running no issues. Buds can be controlled via app helomelody and one plus device have the software built in.Check the app screenshots. First is anc control. You will feel the difference when switching it from anc, off and transparent. You can listen how it will feel when you listen music or speak on call in transparent mode. You can feel the difference awesome feature. Anc will take more battery please note.Sound master let's you select equaliser and increse the bass wave.Game mode is for reducing latency while gaming.Earbud control. You can select 6 functions 3 each buds and that's an upgrade from one plus buds. There is single, double and triple tap. I have keptRight bud double tap next song/take calls, triple tap for previous trackLeft bud double tap voice assistant, 3 nonesingle tap for play for both right and left bud.Touch and hold for changing the anc mode or transparency mode.It also has tap feedback feature means when you tap he word it makes a click sound so that you can know how many times you have tapped the buds. So while you tap it thrice and hear two click sounds that means you have tapped twice and buds will respond to the function assigned to 2 taps.The best feature i found out is device switching. If your buds is paired with multiple devices then you can switch device by tap and hold for 3 secs it will connect to other device easily. I have tried in 2 phones haven't checked for more than 2 device or laptop.Overall it's  worth to buy this buds not to forget all these features on reasonable price. I loved it. It's far better than the one plus buds. Nice work one plus...If you are confused between buds nord and buds nord 2 there is a difference if bluetooth version and drivers that's it.Best and within budget...Edit: while driving the other person will hear lots of noise and speaking on call while driving a 2 wheeler is not at all possible, be aware of that I tried every modes but it just doesn't help.","Reviewed in India on 25 June 2023","Flawless ear buds.

"R3KZ33F03CZR92","Raj Kriti Sinha","Ordered during Great Indian Festival.Effective price after SBI Discount was Rs. 2250/-I ordered this product after thorough research.And I am happy that for this price, it exceeds my expectations.Design - Similar to Nord Buds the first. But, both the gray and white colors have some faint dotted design over the case and the stem of the buds. Faint flue dots over white. I was not prepared for that, at first glance, it looks a little dusty but can be overlooked.Both the case and buds are very lightweight and easy to carry.However, what I found to be a downside is that the buds dont have any magnetic attraction between them, so while they're easy to place in the case, outside the case they can't be clubbed together.Fit - Fits perfectly. No pain/discomfort. When I move my head from side to side, they stay put. I ran on the treadmill for a few minutes at 12kmph. They didn’t even budge. It didn’t feel like they would slip out. Which is great.Call Quality - The thing I was most worried about. And it passes the test. I live on a quiet street though - The other person is able to hear me loud and clear, and sometimes, ambient sound is also audible to them but the volume of that sound is much lower than my voice so it is not bothersome. Even in busier surroundings, no one has complained about my call quality yet!Audio Quality - I'm quite fond of listening to loud music. This does more than just justice to the loudness. I am more than happy listening at 50% volume. It’s definitely bass heavy. The quality of the sound is clear and crisp. I am very happy.ANC - It was not a priority for me, however, I did try it. Noise cancellation is definitely very effective. It does as much as promised, not more. However, there is a faint hissing sound. But it doesn’t bother me when playing some music or audio.Hey Melody - Its NOT detecting my earbuds yet lol. I'm an apple user. Let's see I'll try pairing it properly.Switching between devices - Unpair with one to pair with another. Not much of a hassle though, its fairly quick. And it automatically pairs with my phone as soon as I take it out of the case.Battery Life - Yet to be explored! I’m someone who carries all my chargers on the go and tend to keep all my devices well charged, so I don’t think I’ll be able to face much issue.My Personal Reasons why I didn't go for Buds Z2 even though my budget was flexible -1. In Ear Detection - if it goes haywire, I don't think there's an option to turn it off.2. Glossy finish - I was afraid it would slip out.3. It was released in 2021. About time we got a Z3, no?Reasons why I wanted Z2 -1. 3 mics2. Google pairing - easy switch between devices3. More premium productAm I happy I went with this and not with Z2 - MOST DEFINITELY YES!!!","Reviewed in India on 10 October 2023","Stop overthinking & trust me on this one - does more than just the job at a budget price!","5.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61D4h5mku4L.jpg

"R2LVN60HHEMJBM","Archit C.","As I've used OnePlus Nord Buds 1 as well so i can say that there is good  improvement made in Oneplus Nord Buds 2.The bass was my first priority so yes I'm satisfied with it, the basswave feature helps a lot at that time.

"R3IUQPMYEIDRA5","Ashokprabu K","Design:Good buds, not easily fall from the ears. But the box is not comfortable at jeans pocket, need to be a little comfortable design to keep in pockets.Quality:The quality of the material is really good, Sound quality is good, I cannot say its extraordinary because unable to make a tight push into the ears there is a air gap always, but still the ANC reduces the outside noise good and able to manage and listen the good quality sound.Connectivity:only 6 to 8 meters for a good reception. beyond this will get frequent disconnection. The 6-8 meters also should not have any hurdles then only it will be. While open the box lid it connects to the device a bit annoying, should get connect only when we pick the buds from the box, since there is a magnetic touch given or the buds it should have been handled in that way.Paring:Paring button is on the box near to the charging port, which is really good. should be a little quick responsive for the touch, some times it responses quick some times it did not response for the touch may be its due to the design texture on the touch area.Battery:30 to 40 percent consumption for a 2 hour continuous usage with ANC. Which is quit disappointment, but still it will get charged once we put the buds into the box which is a good thing. Should have to improve the battery consumption a little smarter way. Each buds took different level of consumption I guess this is  due to more touch on one buds.Convenient :For one plus mobile there a dedicated menu given in the Bluetooth setting, to control over the earphone and able to customize the touch controls. may be the touch area can be kept little down to give a good convenience to put the earphone a good push to ears. because when we try to tight the earphones the touch responses which is annoying.","Reviewed in India on 25 October 2023","Acceptable ANC Good Sound","5.0 out of 5 stars","","7","Thunder Grey","Extra Large","Nord Buds 2"

Mic is also good for calls.Cons:The only drawback is the occasionally frustrating touch controls, often misinterpreting taps.Overall:OnePlus Nord Buds 2 stand out in the market with premium sound quality and features. While the touch control issue deducts a star, the product's overall excellence and OnePlus's reliable after-sales service make it a top choice in its category.

"R2C5RUKPNVA6AC","Arjun","It's been a year since my purchase and I am very happy with these mini boom boxes. It does live up to its name of the basswave technology. However, it's best not to be meddled with in terms of the Equalizer. The default setting is perfect. The earphones are durable and so is the case. Backup after full charge is about 5 hours on continuous use and goes up to 15 hours on intermittent use. The only concern overtime is to make sure you clean the mesh every 4 months to keep the sound from getting blocked out. The ANC is not great but works decently well for the price you pay. Bluetooth range is pretty good, goes upto 7 to 8 meters without glitching.The only drawback would be that they don't hold onto your ear like you'd want them to. If you prefer wearing the smallest buds, you'll have a hard time during sweaty summers as the earbuds will slip off quite often when you workout/run etc.Otherwise, a brilliant, value for money product by OnePlus.","Reviewed in India on 22 December 2023","Excellent quality for asking price","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Thunder Grey","Extra Large","Nord Buds 2"

"R3TNEFUSEGDCUA","Devilking","The OnePlus Nord Buds 2 are a pair of affordable true wireless earbuds that offer good sound quality, active noise cancellation (ANC), and a comfortable fit. They are a modest upgrade over their predecessor, the OnePlus Nord Buds, but they are still a good value for the price.**Sound quality**The OnePlus Nord Buds 2 have a balanced sound profile with good bass, mids, and highs. The bass is punchy and impactful, but it doesn't overwhelm the other frequencies. The mids are clear and detailed, and the highs are crisp and extended.The Nord Buds 2 also support Dolby Atmos, which can provide a more immersive listening experience for certain types of content. However, Dolby Atmos is not available on all streaming platforms, and it is not compatible with all types of audio files.**Active noise cancellation**The OnePlus Nord Buds 2 have active noise cancellation (ANC), which can help to reduce ambient noise. The ANC is not as effective as on more expensive earbuds, but it does a decent job of blocking out low-frequency noises, such as the hum of an airplane or the rumble of a bus.**Fit and comfort**The OnePlus Nord Buds 2 are comfortable to wear for long periods of time. They are lightweight and have a secure fit. The earbuds come with three different sizes of ear tips, so you can find the perfect fit for your ears.**Battery life**The OnePlus Nord Buds 2 have a battery life of up to 30 hours on a single charge (with ANC turned off). With ANC turned on, the battery life is reduced to around 24 hours. The charging case provides an additional 30 hours of battery life.**Overall**The OnePlus Nord Buds 2 are a good pair of affordable true wireless earbuds. They offer good sound quality, active noise cancellation, and a comfortable fit. If you are looking for a budget-friendly pair of earbuds with ANC, the Nord Buds 2 are a good option to consider.**Pros:*** Good sound quality* Active noise cancellation* Comfortable fit* Affordable price**Cons:*** ANC is not as effective as on more expensive earbuds* Dolby Atmos is not available on all streaming platforms and is not compatible with all types of audio files**Who should buy the OnePlus Nord Buds 2?**The OnePlus Nord Buds 2 are a good choice for people who are looking for a pair of affordable true wireless earbuds with good sound quality and active noise cancellation.

"R1KFONDZFEC71J","Padmam","After 3 years of extremely rough use knockoff Chinese wireless Bluetooth earbud kicked the bucket. Earbud, because one of them still work(and people say Chinese tech is poorly made). At the time of buying those knockoff earbuds it was around the same price as these One Plus Nord Buds 2 price range, actually I believe it was slightly cheaper(I cannot for the life of me remember). I am not a heavy earbuds user, I mostly use it to listen to podcasts in the morning and pair it with my laptop to listen to music while I work at night. The buds seldom leave the vicinity of my work desk at home, no exposure to the elements of nature and no exposure to sweat. I clean my earbuds regularly. That being said I do listen to a wide range of music, I'm no audiophile, but can identify change in quality in the listening device.With that in mind, these earbuds offer an okay sound quality, hence why I gave it 4 stars, the sound quality is clear and don't have much noise, the trebles are well balanced so as to not rupture your eardrums, but the bass is overblown which is why I gave it 3 stars. The bass drowns out the other sounds, and overwhelms your ear. Especially if you are listening to an orchestral piece, you'll struggle appreciate the individual artists. This can be solved with software to a certain extent. By using the ""HeyMelody"" app you can configure your OnePlus Nord Buds 2. You can use pre configured sound profiles like Balanced, Bold, Serenade, or Bass. There is also the BassWave option which allows you to adjust the clarity and fidelity of the bass via software. If you are still unsatisfied you can configure your own custom profile by adding an equalizer and creating the ideal audio setup.Now one of the more attractive feature of these buds I have seen from other buyers is the ANC at this price point. Honestly I don't really use the feature that much, mostly because I like to be aware of my surroundings and not get completely immersed in whatever I'm doing on the computer/phone. But the ANC works kinda well? I mean it's not the same as Apple's ANC, but for 3k you should temper your expectations. By holding down on the touch gesture surface on the ear buds or by going into the app on your phone you can enable ANC. It was able to completely tune out the ambient buzzing sound of my Air Conditioning, which is old and loud, so I think the ANC is very good. The only thing is when there is no audio playing you'll hear a hissing or buzzing sound if you have ANC enabled. It's not super annoying, but that is just my personal opinion.As for battery backup, I have managed to go 2 days without charging the buds, but this is with light usage. It still has 90% left even after I have used it for 2 days so I think the battery backup is good. The case is sturdy and the buds fall into place within the case magnetically. Bluetooth connectivity is seamless and that's all I have to say about the buds.I have however talked to people that bought these buds as a part of expanding their OnePlus ecosystem, and they claim that these buds are amazing when paired with their OnePlus phone or OnePlus tablet. I wouldn't know, I don't believe in ecosystems.But people, for 3k this is totally worth the price. Haven't met with any issues till now, if I do I'll make sure to update this review.

"RG87IJA4CMOIK","Anweshan Roy Chowdhury","These are quite great. At their price range, it feels expensive - but is more than valuable. I have been using them for 2 days now and they feel pretty good.Design1. Premium design, with metallic case and buds too.2. TWS Snaps into place quickly, with really strong magnets.3. Also the metallic design has specs of white color marks on the case (for Thunder Grey). I mistook this for dust and tried to rub it off 😂.4. Cons: I found the cable a little short for charging, but its okay since I have my own Type-C charger anyway5. CONS: At this price range, I would expect a volume control on the buds, given the customization possible through the app.App1. The app is also good but not great. It has a host of options from customizing your buds to specific task. I found in the app store, people are complaining there isn't any equalizer, but actually there is.2. Find my buds feature is also cool (atleast they tried at this price range. Do not compare to air pods or samsung buds)3. CONS: Like I said the App is well thought off both UI & UX wise, but from a developers (myself) standpoint - there is still room for improvement.Connectivity1. I use a Samsung phone, but the guide is pretty clear on how to do so. My Bluetooth almost caught them and paired immediately.2. Auto wake up pairing is also working with the last device provided the device Bluetooth still on. If not the bud switches to the device before it. If none of these are found, then it is just idle, and you need to turn on some devices Bluetooth.3. Device switching: Configured through the app, the feature is actually great.Sound:1. I find it has a good bass, but I am not a sound guy.2. The app has many enhances & equalizers which enhance the sound quality.Modes:1. ANC - The 25db works for traffic and underground metro perspective (2 things I tested). It also works well if you are trying to ignore your family always talking.2. The game mode reduces considerable lag.3. The environment mode (forgot name) - which gives us ambient noise is also cool when walking on a street.4. CONS: A jingle plays on going from one mode to another. So many jingles confuse me. I would prefer a person saying like ""ANC"" or ""Game Mode"" etc.Navigation (Touch Button):The multi-functional touch button on the buds is great and responsive. Again, I would like a ""sound notification"" instead of a jingle, but thats my preference. Otherwise call pickup, drop, next, prev, assistant, switching modes, switching devices are all excellent.Overall, I would say it's a great bud to go for at the given price range of something around 2.5K. Anything greater wait for it to drop.","Reviewed in India on 6 January 2024","If you can, buy it","5.0 out of 5 stars","","6","Thunder Grey","Extra Large","Nord Buds 2"

"RU73STR04PPE2","sazeer","I bought this product recently. Used it full-fledged for about 10 days. I am using this product with realme gt2 pro.Lets talk about cons first1. Ear comfort of this product is ok but not  great. Using more than 1 hr ear  starts to hurt and painful. You need to  remove buds from ear and then keep  again to tackle the pain. I tried other ear  tips which comes in the box. tried small  ear tips which made comfort even worse  and painful.2 when audio is paused you will hear some  kind of gizzz sound which is very  annoying may be it is to handle outside  sound it seems. In transparency mode  gizz sound is less as you will hear outside  noise. When your not playing anything  keep buds aside or in the box donot  keep in ears. Trust me you will definitely  feel discomfort.3 ANC - Active Noise Cancellation is  working good but not great. You can still  hear outside noises. But it does have  difference. 50 percent of noises will be  reduced but not complete isolation.4 Hey Melody App. when phone bluetooth  is on buds will automatically pairs which  is great but when you go into app it still  shows select device to connect. But from  bluetooth settings i am able to select  and configure the product. I feel if device  is connected app should atleast show it  is connected.Pros 1. Sound Quality is great. 2. Bass is great. 3. Switching with between multiple device  is great as it wont automatically shift to  other device and you have to touch and  hold long to  shift and continue using. It  can be configure from app. 4. Battery backup is good. 5. Having ANC in this price is great. 6. Ear fitting is great. It wont fall from the  ear.Hope this review helps..!!","Reviewed in India on 20 May 2023","Worth the price","4.0 out of 5 stars","","502","Thunder Grey","Extra Large","Nord Buds 2"

I do have OnePlus mobile but I also connect this to my laptop for zoom meetings but everytime when I try to connect this in laptop it's an nightmare.Connectivity range is ok but when you want to disconnect, most of the times it gets hanged. It will be totally ridiculous for you to sit and troubleshoot every time.Charge retention is absolute joke. Mostly it will be retained for 3-4 hrs and not more than that.

"R2K43ZH8ROGHTH","Abhishek","Been using the one plus Nord buds for quite some until I lost the charging case. Experience was good so ordered Nord buds 2 but there seems to be an issue with the touch panels. Having real difficulty disconnecting calls, which is supposed to be the main function. Surprisingly all other touch functions like mode change and track change seem to work well. No point telling me that I'm not used to the positioning of the touch panels because been using the earlier version for quite some time and I'm quite used to it. Must be a faulty product or a manufacturing issue.

"R2HND1Y7KSD9QC","Abhishek","Buying a tws headphones can be very confusing given the number of options within the under 5k budget range. I bought the OP Nord buds because I already had a One plus phone and there was a level of trust for the company for the quality of their products. But I was quite disappointed by this purchase so much so that I wanted to return then on the same day I received them. Here's are the pros and cons from my experience.Pros:- Build quality: the build quality is good. It comes in a really nice charging case. It closes with a satisfying snap and the magnets in the case made sure the buds stayed in place in the case.- fit: they fit quite well in the ear. I didn't have any worry about them falling off.- they look good.- instant connectCons:- Really disappointing sound quality: for a product that you're spending so much money on the sound quality was really average. If you like bass you will be really upset. If you're a music lover then you'll feel how the sound quality does no justice to the music.- App support: I bought these because I already had a one plus phone (6T) because I thought connectivity and compatibility will be a breeze. However I got no such thing. The hey melody app, which is there for non-one plus phone users to customise the buds, asks you to go to the phones Bluetooth settings to adjust and customise but the bluetooth settings have no such option. The hey melody app allows for no further customisation.- ears tend to hurt after long term use.I would suggest if you are looking for a good midrange tws earphones you should definitely go for the cheaper alternatives. This one's definitely not worth the money. I am now using Oppo enco buds and they are way better in terms of sound quality and bass and they cost a ₹1000 lesser than these.","Reviewed in India on 25 August 2022","Average sound quality","2.0 out of 5 stars","","0","White Marble","Extra Large","Nord Buds"

The left earbud is lower than the right one, you can hear others speak but your voice won't transmit! The build quality is disgustingly bad and they won't stay in your ears.They are not build for durability. They are not built for long time use or even comfortablity.

"R3K7YZLXBMXQSU","Ramandeep Singh","The OnePlus Nord Buds 2 truly impressed me with their outstanding audio performance. While the Active Noise Cancellation may not be the most powerful, it still effectively reduces surrounding noise, creating a more immersive listening experience.The 12.4mm driver unit sets these earbuds apart from the competition, providing a level of sound clarity and depth that is unparalleled in its price range. The bass quality, enhanced by the BassWave Technology, adds a new dimension to my music, making every beat feel more vibrant and enjoyable.The inclusion of the dedicated app is a fantastic addition, allowing me to fine-tune the sound with the Master Equalizers. Whether I want a balanced sound, emphasize vocals, or seek a transparent audio experience, I can easily adjust the settings to match my preferences for different types of content.With a remarkable battery life of up to 36 hours on a single charge, the OnePlus Nord Buds 2 are perfect for extended use, whether I'm on a long journey or just immersed in my favorite playlists all day long.In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord Buds 2 have proven to be a top-notch choice for anyone seeking a high-quality and customizable audio experience. Despite the moderate ANC, the exceptional sound quality, bass enhancement, and user-friendly app make these earbuds a compelling purchase that I wholeheartedly recommend. They have quickly become my go-to earphones for all my audio needs.One thing to note about the OnePlus Nord Buds 2 is that the case can be quite slippery. While the earbuds themselves fit securely in the case, the smooth exterior can sometimes make it challenging to grip, especially if you're on the move.To address this issue, I highly recommend purchasing a silicon skin for the case. Adding a silicon skin not only provides better grip and handling but also offers additional protection against scratches and minor bumps. It's a practical investment to ensure the safety and longevity of both the earbuds and the case.Overall, with the added silicon skin, the OnePlus Nord Buds 2 become an even more desirable choice, providing an excellent audio experience, customizable features, and now, enhanced practicality and protection for everyday use.","Reviewed in India on 22 July 2023","My Best TWS yet","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Lightning White","Extra Large","Nord Buds 2"

The case is so stylish and good build the hinge is very good. The transparency mode is also good but it's a bit robot for the price it's worth it!

"R36HIU8H58694D","Nandakishore.S.H","My wife was using these earbuds for several months and thus I too decided to purchase it.Pros:1) Compact design, fits comfortably in the ear.2) Has decent active noise cancellation along with decent bass output in its price range..3) Supports fast charging and good battery back up.4) I play Call of duty mobile in my samsung device...  These earbuds provide a decent latency for gaming.Cons: 1) No default volume increase or decrese option. I think we need to customize in hey melody app.2) There is no proper charge level indicator. Just a single LED which changes its colour from green to red. But we can check the phone to know the exact percentage of charge...  Thus its not a big issue.3) May not be 100% compatible to Xiomi devices...  There is some distortions whilebgaming and watching videos.I bought it for around Rs 2500...which is really a good deal. You can go for it without any second thought. Hope this helps...","Reviewed in India on 29 October 2023","Decent TWC earbuds with ANC.","5.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Mk2IajGLL.jpg","6","Thunder Grey","Extra Large","Nord Buds 2"
