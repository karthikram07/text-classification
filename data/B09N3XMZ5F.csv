"R3RE38OETKXLGF","Kuldeep Kumar","First of all I am writing this review after using these extensively for about 8 months and I was so impressed with the overall sound quality, functionality and battery backup of these TWS that I bought three of these. Two from amazon and one from offline market.PROS1. Sound Quality: The sound quality is great for this budget. You will enjoy watching movies and listening to songs on these. The trebble is good so you will hear the dialogs very clearly. Base is decent at this price point but don’t expect them to be too good on the base as these are budget TWS but again the sound is great for what you are paying for.2. Battery Backup: For this budget the battery backup on these tiny things is outstanding. You can easily watch a full 3.5 to 4 hour movie without worrying that the battery will die. Infact, I have even used these straight for more than 4 hours and its battery never gave up on me. Adding to that, the case itself has its own battery so the buds will charge as soon as you put them back in the case so basically the battery lasts for more than a week if you use them daily on regular basis for 3-4 hours daily.3. Durability: After using them for about 8 months I can assure you that these will not fail on you and are very durable. All three of them which I bought are working fine without any issues. I also suggested them to some of my friends and collegues and their TWS are also working fine till date.4. Touch Sensors: You get touch sensors on each of the buds which you can use to play, pause, skip tracks, next and previous songs in the list, picking up calls etc.5. Latency: On normal mode I didn’t find them lagging behind but if you want to use them for gaming with super low latency then it comes with something called ‘BEAST MODE’ which further improves latency but at the cost of faster battery drain. So you can definitely use them for gaming. To switch to ‘Beast Mode’ just tap thrice on the touch sensors on any of the buds.6. Size: These are tiny. You can see the photo where I have put them besides a AA battery to have an idea of their size. So you can put these in your pocket without making them bulky. These are super portable.7. USB C Charging: These have a USB C port for charging so you can charge these easily with your phone charger. You can also find a USB A to C charging cable inside the box.8. Connectivity: Pairing these with your phone is super simple and quick. The phone remembers the connection so when you turn your Bluetooth on next time it will connect automatically to these. Moreover, you can use only one bud at a time and keep the other one in the case and later one if you do decide to use both then you can simple take out the other one from the case and it will connect automatically with the one already connected to your phone.9. Different size ear plugs: These also comes with different size ear plugs so you can pick one that fits your ears for better comfort.10. Fast charging: Once you put the earbuds inside the case they charge real fast so even if they run out of battery (which they don’t, trust me) you can charge them up in just 5 minutes for almost an hour of playback.11. Battery level LEDs: The case have four LEDs on the front that shows you the battery level and charging status. You can also see the battery percentage of the buds on the phone when they are connected to it.CONS:1. Build: Though the build is very good, out of three I bought two of them came with a loose cap that was a little wobbly. Though the wobble was very minimum but still I felt that the build quality is not consistent.2. Less Base: The base not these TWS is not that great but as I said these are budget TWS that comes with decent base for the price.3. Range: The range is surely not their strength. You will loose connection if you go far from your source OR will experience sound drop if anything like wall etc. comes between these TWS and the source. But if you are sitting close to the source with clear line of sight in 3-5 m radius then you will have best connection without any signal drops. Additionally I also experienced signal drops when they have almost 20 to 30% battery left so make sure you keep the buds and case charged above these levels.4. Not for workouts: These will slip from your ears if you use them for intense workouts or jogging as they don’t have the ear hooks.5. Battery percentage: You cannot see the exact battery percentage for the case as it does not have a display.6. USB C Cable: The supplied USB C cable is very short as you can see in the pictures. But since everyone will most likely charge them using their phone charges so it’s not a big deal.7. Microphone: Each of the earbuds have a microphone built in for calling but when I tried these over a call, I got a feedback from my friend that he was not hearing my voice very well when compared to my phone’s inbuilt microphone. So I don’t recommend these for attending voice calls.","Reviewed in India on 12 July 2023","Budget-friendly with Great Sound and Battery Backup!","5.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6187p7fuGXL.jpg

"R3ENKUSVAR2PL","RVS","The boAt Airdopes 141 are wireless earbuds that offer a decent sound quality, long battery life, and low latency mode for gaming. They are also IPX4 water-resistant and have touch controls and voice assistant support. However, they also have some drawbacks, such as a bulky case, average noise cancellation, and lack of volume control on the earbuds. Here are some pros and cons of the boAt Airdopes 141:ProsSound quality: The earbuds have 8mm dynamic drivers that deliver clear and balanced sound with good bass. The boAt signature sound is immersive and enjoyable for most genres of music12Battery life: The earbuds have a playback time of up to 6 hours per charge and an additional 36 hours with the case. They also support ASAP fast charge technology that gives up to 75 minutes of playtime with just 5 minutes of charging. The case has a Type-C port for convenient charging12Low latency mode: The earbuds have a BEAST mode that reduces the audio lag while gaming or watching videos. The low latency mode can be activated by tapping the left earbud three times. This feature enhances the gaming experience and syncs the audio with the video12IPX4 water resistance: The earbuds are protected from water and sweat splashes with an IPX4 rating. This makes them suitable for outdoor activities and workouts. They can withstand light rain and sweat without any damage12Touch controls and voice assistant: The earbuds have quick response touch controls that allow you to play/pause music, answer/reject calls, activate voice assistant, and switch between modes. You can also access your default voice assistant (Siri or Google Assistant) with a single tap on the right earbud. The touch controls are responsive and easy to use12ConsBulky case: The case of the earbuds is quite large and heavy compared to other wireless earbuds in this price range. It may not fit easily in your pocket or bag. The case also has a glossy finish that attracts fingerprints and scratches easily34Average noise cancellation: The earbuds have ENx environmental noise cancellation technology that reduces the background noise during calls. However, the noise cancellation is not very effective and you may still hear some ambient sounds while listening to music or talking on the phone. The earbuds also do not have active noise cancellation (ANC) or transparency mode features that are available in some higher-end models34Lack of volume control: The earbuds do not have any option to adjust the volume level on the earbuds themselves. You have to use your phone or other connected device to change the volume. This can be inconvenient if you want to quickly lower or increase the volume without reaching for your phone34ConclusionThe boAt Airdopes 141 are wireless earbuds that offer good value for money with their sound quality, battery life, low latency mode, IPX4 water resistance, touch controls, and voice assistant support. They are ideal for casual listening, gaming, and workouts. However, they also have some drawbacks, such as a bulky case, average noise cancellation, and lack of volume control on the earbuds. If you are looking for wireless earbuds that are affordable, durable, and functional, you can consider the boAt Airdopes 141.","Reviewed in India on 19 July 2023","The boAt Airdopes 141 are wireless earbuds that offer good value for money","4.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Wuk5JpRKL.jpg","149","Bold Black","Without ANC"

"R2JVWQMAK63B7D","Rishi Raj Rai","It is a good deal for the price. However, it does not have a good microphone so sometimes you would have to hold one of the earbuds near your mouth so that voice can properly transmit. Also, it does not connect sometimes, so you have to close the earbuds in the case again and take them out sometimes, you have to do it 2-3 times. But rest is good. Battery life lasts for a good time though I don't use them much so can't tell.","Reviewed in India on 18 January 2024","Okeyish","4.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Bold Black","Without ANC"

Previously I was using airdops 161 which had 13 mm drivers and trust me those sounded very bad due to overpowered bass and 8mm drivers in airdops 141 beat that in sound quality. 8mm doesn't mean it doesn't have bass. It has adequate amount of bass and trebles are good too. Case seems durable.I primarily bought it for music and it didn't disappoint me. Calling quality is ok, not bad. I don't play games so I didn't need low latency.Fit is ok but can't sleep on side with these.I bought it in 1.3k. Anyway, If you can grab it at 1.1k-1.2k would be a good deal.I'll change rating to 5 if it lasts 1 year at least.Only one con; Wish boat had provided us app to control touch gestures, just like Realme's realme link  and oppo's hey melody app.","Reviewed in India on 24 December 2023","Better than Airdops 161","4.0 out of 5 stars","","4","Pure White","Without ANC"

"R15VU576KDCPNJ","Shalini A.","I recently got the product and I had to say that the quality of the packaging was pretty good and it gave a premium kind of feel. The product quality is good but more work can be done to make the earbuds resistent to fall damage. the ANC is good enough to block sounds like fan or cooler or ac exhaust if they are a bit far in the room and the ambient mode and normal mode are good too and work as expected. sound quality is very decent although not much bass is to be expected and the two audio modes are pretty good although couldn't hear much of a difference yet. battery life is great doesn't require much charge and it also connects fast with mobile although it may take time or manual work in laptops and for the price its pretty good although a few quality issues can be resolved and the cable provided can be made longer if possible as most wall adapters are way of the ground or table. will  update review in futureUPDATE : alright it has been a while and I have been using this regularly and I have spotted a problem that it more often than not it out of nowhere disconnects and you have to comnect it again by tapping its name in Bluetooth setting in the phone which is very annoying and sometimes it will happen a few times in a row although it might be a battery issue but its something I would expect not to happen after paying this much price also I have found that bass is better sounding in signature sound mode","Reviewed in India on 2 September 2023","best ANC tws in the price range","4.0 out of 5 stars","","151","Gunmetal Black","with ANC"
"R3TV89WGE6PPK8","abhijeet mane","Design and Build (4/5):The Boat Airdopes 141 ANC earbuds boast a sleek and modern design, earning them points for aesthetics. The charging case feels sturdy and pocket-friendly. However, they lose a point due to their slightly bulky form factor. The earbuds themselves are comfortable and secure in-ear.Audio Quality (2.5/5):Here's where the Boat Airdopes 141 ANC fall short. While they are acceptable for casual listening, the audio quality is a major letdown. The sound lacks the depth and richness expected from premium earbuds. It's almost akin to using a pair of 100rs headphones, which is disappointing for a product in this price range.Noise Cancellation (3/5):The active noise cancellation on these earbuds is decent but not exceptional. It manages to reduce ambient noise to some extent but struggles in particularly noisy environments. The effectiveness is somewhat underwhelming when compared to other models in this category.Battery Life (4.5/5):One of the strong points of the Boat Airdopes 141 ANC is their battery life.Connectivity (5/5):The Boat Airdopes 141 ANC impress with their Bluetooth 5.3 technology, ensuring a fast and stable connection. Pairing is seamless, and the earbuds maintain a reliable connection without any noticeable dropouts during use.Controls and Features (3/5):While the touch controls are handy for managing playback and calls, there's a notable drawback. The earbuds tend to turn off when you activate the ANC, which can be quite frustrating. This feature inconsistency lowers the overall user experience.**Call Quality (4.5/5):**The call quality on these earbuds is commendable. They perform well in both quiet and moderately noisy environments, providing clear and distortion-free audio for conversations.**Conclusion (3/5):**In summary, the Boat Airdopes 141 ANC offer a mixed experience. They shine in terms of battery life and connectivity, but their audio quality disappoints, resembling that of budget headphones. The noise cancellation is acceptable but not outstanding, and the control quirks can be frustrating. If you prioritize battery life and connectivity and can compromise on audio quality, these earbuds might be suitable for you. However, if audio quality is paramount, you might want to explore other options in this price range.","Reviewed in India on 31 August 2023","Boat Airdopes 141 ANC -  Rating: ★★★☆☆ (3/5)","3.0 out of 5 stars","","289","Gunmetal Black","with ANC"
"R358NYWUQLR163","Dillip","Pros:1. The level of volume it gets to, is just awesome, it can get incredibly loud so if you're at the gym, these are perfect.2. Awesome Bass!3. Noise cancellation is just great, if you simply put them on without even any music playing, u won't be able to hear things around u very well, it's great for places like Gym.4. Lovely battery life, I've had them a week and only had to charge the case once, that too for just a few minutes. And the earbuds themselves, leave them in case for just five min and you'll be getting battery for a long long while.5. They are very comfortable, can be used for long periods of time.6. Affordable!7. The touch controls are very responsive, tap to pause, double tap right one for next song, double tap left one for either rewind or previous song. Can also pick up calls just by tapping.8. Multiple ear coverings are provided with it.9. Type C portCons:1. The sound quality is not bad or anything but it is slightly muffled as compared to good quality headphones etc. The bass is the highlight so it's great for music, but for movies or gaming, you won't get the most crisp audio.2. Some connectivity issues, sometimes i have to turn my Bluetooth on and off many times for it to work (this is occasional, not a daily or frequent occurrence) [Edit after 1 month use: it's now a very frequent issue]3. The mic quality is good if you are using your phone, but for some reason the quality is really bad if you are on PC4. Sometimes on WhatsApp, the mic will not be detected if you are on call with these earbuds, so you will end up having to take them off to accept a call sometimes. (Not an issue if you are the one dialing) i hope it's just a whatsapp issue rather than earbuds issue.Overall, I needed these for my gym since they play horrible music there (lol) so I'm very very happy with themHighly recommended for music and/or as a more affordable option as compared to JBL etc.","Reviewed in India on 2 January 2023","great product under low price range","4.0 out of 5 stars","","298","Bold Black","Without ANC"
"R28MSMZAAE1C3N","Harish Kumar","It was good, but lasts for only 8 to 9 months at most. In my case, I got charging issue as the pods were not able to charge from the case and I was no longer able to use it again. In the time I used it, I got pairing and connectivity issues sometimes. The pods would automatically disconnect in the middle of nowhere and I had to turn off the Bluetooth on my phone and on it again multiple times to connect it again. Just so you know that my Bluetooth on the phone is not at all a problem cuz my phone is perfectly alright and pairs well with other devices I connect.I am giving only 3 because, It can improve more in terms of case quality and its charging fearure to bots cuz mine was that problem. One more is the pairing and connectivity issue. Also call quality can be improved. BUT I must say that the sound quality is exceptionally beyond my expectations.

"R36WFDPRC6P5J4","Ashik Latheef","Title: A Reliable Choice for Wireless EarbudsRating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)I recently purchased a pair of true wireless earbuds, and after using them for a while, I can confidently say that they offer a satisfying listening experience with a few minor drawbacks.Pros:1. Sound Quality (★★★★☆): The sound quality of these earbuds is impressive, with clear highs and punchy bass. They provide an immersive audio experience, making music and podcasts enjoyable.2. Comfort (★★★★☆): The earbuds are comfortable to wear for extended periods. They come with multiple ear tip options, ensuring a snug fit and good passive noise isolation.3. Connectivity (★★★★☆): Pairing is straightforward, and the Bluetooth connection remains stable. The earbuds quickly connect to my devices, which is convenient.4. Battery Life (★★★☆☆): The battery life is decent, offering several hours of playback on a single charge. The charging case provides additional hours, making them suitable for daily use.Cons:1. Build Quality (★★★☆☆): While they feel lightweight and compact, the build quality leaves something to be desired. The plastic construction feels a bit flimsy, and I worry about their long-term durability.2. Touch Controls (★★★☆☆): The touch controls can be a bit finicky. Sometimes, accidental touches occur when adjusting the earbuds, which can be frustrating.3. Microphone (★★☆☆☆): The microphone quality is below par, particularly in noisy environments. Call quality suffers, and it can be challenging for others to hear you clearly.4. Limited Features (★★★☆☆): Compared to premium models, these earbuds lack some advanced features like active noise cancellation or advanced app integration.In summary, these true wireless earbuds are a reliable and budget-friendly choice for those seeking good sound quality and comfort. They are a suitable option for music enthusiasts and casual users. However, if you prioritize durability, advanced features, or crystal-clear call quality, you might want to consider higher-end alternatives.","Reviewed in India on 7 November 2023","good product","4.0 out of 5 stars","","6","Cider Cyan","Without ANC"

Great battery life.. With volume around 50-60% ANC on - buds: around 5hrs with case ≈30-32hrs depending on volume and without ANC increased by 0.5-1hr battery not close to advertised levelsCons:-1.Balanced sound is a gimmick, I've used several hires earphones with balanced sounds and had my expectations low but this managed to let me down further. Everything sounds tinny and hollow with no real warmth or quality to it. Seems like the drivers are turned to be bass heavy at factory and no amount of EQ tuning could bring them down to normal. Disappointed as I love balanced > bass heavy mode. Others might disagree as everyone seems to love bass in excess.2. Featherlight build(again) the case and buds feel fragile compared to the original boat 141 which felt like a tank.3. Can't use custom eartips apart from those in box as the case won't close with any eartips other than those given,used a boat 141(original )with custom Sony eartips ,they were perfect and was disappointed by the lack of support for this product4. Transparency mode is not good enough5. ANC fails at higher ambient sounds, passive cancellation on the old boat 141 was better compared to the ANC on this productIt's easy already crazy high how much bass majority of us Indians love, But nowadays it's reaching extreme levels, People who love and are used to Balanced audio on hi res earphones avoid them at all costs.

"R1DFW2Q01DV6JR","Hitesh Chauhan","My experience with the Boat Bluetooth Aidopes 141 was nothing short of a disaster, and the aftermath of dealing with their after-service support has been a nightmare I wouldn't wish upon anyone. This product's performance issues were exacerbated by the company's complete lack of professionalism and incompetence in handling customer complaints.To begin with, the Aidopes 141's sound quality was far from satisfactory. The audio output was muffled and lacked any clarity, making it impossible to enjoy music or take calls without constant frustration. Despite trying different devices and settings, the problem persisted, leaving me utterly dissatisfied with my purchase.Seeking a resolution, I decided to contact Boat's after-service support. This is where the real nightmare began. It was nearly impossible to get in touch with their customer support team. Phone calls went unanswered, and the few times I managed to reach someone, they seemed disinterested and unhelpful. This indifference towards their customers is inexcusable.When I finally managed to lodge a complaint about the poor sound quality, I was asked to ship the earbuds back for inspection and possible replacement. I did so promptly, only to face a prolonged period of silence from the company. They failed to provide any updates on the status of my return, leaving me in the dark and frustrated.After weeks of waiting, I contacted their customer support yet again to inquire about my replacement request. To my astonishment, they claimed to have no record of receiving my package. I was appalled by their lack of responsibility and accountability. I had sent the earbuds back with a tracking number, and I could prove they had been delivered.Even after providing them with the tracking details, they seemed indifferent to my predicament. I had to go through countless follow-up calls and emails just to get a vague response from their end. The process of issuing a replacement was plagued with delays and a complete disregard for customer satisfaction.When the replacement earbuds finally arrived, I hoped for an improved product, but my hopes were swiftly dashed. The new pair had the same sound quality issues as the original one. It was evident that the company had done nothing to address the problem and had merely sent me a refurbished unit that was just as faulty.Frustrated and exhausted from dealing with Boat's after-service support, I decided to cut my losses and give up on the Aidopes 141 altogether. The entire experience has left me deeply disappointed and disillusioned with the brand.In conclusion, the Boat Bluetooth Aidopes 141 is a subpar product with dismal performance and a company that shows no regard for customer satisfaction or after-service support. I strongly advise against purchasing this product, as you'll likely be left with a faulty device and an unsolvable headache if you encounter any issues. Look elsewhere for reliable and customer-centric brands that stand behind their products.","Reviewed in India on 21 July 2023","Bad Service Support","1.0 out of 5 stars","","39","Cider Cyan","Without ANC"

"R3VJI02MYC6GNV","Shivam Phukan","I recently purchased the Boat 141 Airdopes with high hopes of experiencing exceptional sound quality and seamless connectivity. While the initial impressions were promising, my experience took a downturn after just 10 days of use. Here's my honest review of the Boat 141 Airdopes:Pros:Sound Quality: The Boat 141 Airdopes did not disappoint in the sound department. The audio quality was impressive, delivering clear and immersive sound with good bass and crisp highs. Listening to music and taking calls was a pleasure due to the balanced audio output.Cons:Reliability Issues: Unfortunately, my excitement was short-lived. After just 10 days of use, one of the airdopes refused to charge, rendering it unusable. This left me quite frustrated, as a product at this price point should not encounter such issues within such a short time frame.Bluetooth Connectivity Glitch: Another issue I encountered was with the promised automatic Bluetooth disconnection when placing the airdopes inside the charging case. This feature, which was a selling point for me, ceased to function correctly. I had to manually disconnect the Bluetooth connection each time, which defeated the purpose of convenience that wireless earbuds should offer.Widespread Issue: Seeking a solution, I visited the Boat service center, only to find a crowd of people with similar complaints. It was disheartening to see that many other users were facing the same problem of one airdope refusing to charge. This suggests a potential manufacturing or design flaw that Boat needs to address urgently.Customer Service:On a positive note, Boat's customer service was responsive and agreed to replace the faulty product. However, there's an underlying concern about the reliability of the replacement unit, given the widespread issues reported by other users.Conclusion:In conclusion, the Boat 141 Airdopes offer great sound quality but are marred by serious reliability issues. The premature failure of one airdope and the Bluetooth connectivity glitch were disappointing setbacks. While Boat's willingness to replace the faulty unit is appreciated, it raises doubts about the product's overall quality and longevity.If Boat can address these manufacturing defects and ensure consistent performance, the Boat 141 Airdopes could be an excellent choice for those seeking quality wireless audio. As of now, however, I remain skeptical about recommending these earbuds to others until these issues are fully resolved.","Reviewed in India on 14 August 2023","Mixed Experience with Boat 141 Airdopes - Great Sound Quality but Reliability Issues","1.0 out of 5 stars","","18","Bold Black","Without ANC"
"R2MGFOQE1S58ZP","Meet Rana","I recently had the misfortune of making a purchase on Amazon that turned out to be a complete nightmare. The experience was so horrendous that I feel compelled to share my grievances and dissatisfaction with their service.When I received the courier, I immediately noticed two holes in the packaging. This immediately raised suspicion and led me to believe that something was amiss. Despite my reservations, I proceeded to open the package, only to discover that the product inside was far from what I expected. The item was old and worn, with multiple unsightly scratches on its surface.Naturally, I did what any responsible customer would do in such a situation—I raised a complaint with Amazon, requesting either a replacement or a refund. Little did I know that this would be the beginning of an infuriating ordeal.Amazon's response to my complaint was nothing short of appalling. They dragged their feet for a staggering 5-7 days before getting back to me, during which time my frustration and disappointment only grew. To add insult to injury, their eventual response was to refuse my request for a refund or replacement, and they even had the audacity to place the blame squarely on the customer, as if I had caused the product's poor condition myself.Such a lack of accountability and customer service is simply unacceptable. I have never encountered such a terrible experience with any other online retailer. Amazon's inability to address a legitimate customer complaint and their blatant attempt to shirk responsibility for the subpar product they delivered is utterly infuriating.I would rate Amazon's service far below 1 star if I could. My overall satisfaction with this purchase and the way Amazon handled it is abysmally low. I can confidently say that I will never again order from Amazon, and I will be sure to share my dismal experience with friends and family to ensure they are aware of the company's lackluster customer service and disregard for customer satisfaction.","Reviewed in India on 1 September 2023","Worst Purchase Experience Ever - Total Unsatisfaction","1.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514ArL3VYsL.jpg

"R3K1L1YUXRL1B5","Soniya D","Rating: ★☆☆☆☆I recently purchased the boAt Airdopes 141 Bluetooth Truly Wireless in Ear Headphones with high hopes, but my experience has been nothing short of a nightmare. I received the wrong product, and despite numerous attempts to reach out to the customer support team, I haven't received any response, making matters worse.Firstly, the product I received was not the one I ordered. Instead of the boAt Airdopes 141 with the promised features like 42H playtime, Low Latency Mode for Gaming, ENx Tech, IWP, IPX4 Water Resistance, and Smooth Touch Controls in Pure White, I was sent an entirely different model that lacked these crucial specifications. This careless error has left me frustrated and questioning the reliability of the seller.To make matters worse, the lack of any response from the customer support team is completely unacceptable. I reached out to them immediately after discovering the wrong product, but it seems like they have ignored my complaint entirely. The absence of communication and support from the company only adds to my disappointment and feeling of being deceived as a customer.Moreover, the smooth touch controls that were supposed to enhance the user experience turned out to be incredibly finicky and inconsistent. Often, the controls failed to register my inputs, leading to frequent frustration while trying to use the headphones.Additionally, the promised 42-hour playtime seemed like a distant dream. The battery life fell far short of expectations, leaving me charging the Airdopes almost every day, which is not what I signed up for.The IPX4 water resistance claim also came into question when the headphones malfunctioned after a light drizzle during an outdoor workout. I expected better durability and reliability, especially given the product's description.Overall, my experience with the boAt Airdopes 141 has been utterly disappointing. I received the wrong product, and the lack of response from customer support only exacerbates the issue. The unreliable touch controls, underwhelming battery life, and questionable water resistance have left me with a sense of regret for choosing this product. I urge potential buyers to think twice before purchasing these headphones and to consider other options with more reliable customer support and better quality assurance.","Reviewed in India on 4 August 2023","Extremely Disappointed - Received Wrong Product and Zero Customer Support","1.0 out of 5 stars","","13","Pure White","Without ANC"

I had purchased Airdopes 141 from Amazon and it's left side started producing some crackling sound after few months itself. So i claimed the warranty and sent it for replacement and i received the replacement but there was only the left side earbud in it and the RIGHT SIDE WAS MISSING. I was out of station when i received the replacement so i could open it only after few days and as soon as i got to know 1 side is missing i sent a mail but i got an irrelevant response. After trying a lot i got to speak to a customer care executive she said nothing can be done now as i should have updated in 48hrs whereas nowhere it's mentioned that i have to update within 48hrs of receiving the product. Pure cheating and pathetic service from boat's end.They are just selling cheap product and worst service in the name of selling reasonable products. Will never recommend boat products to anybody. Finally i had to DM on Boat's Instagram page for a relevant reply but even though they responded eventually they could do nothing due to the 48hr time period WHICH WAS MENTIONED NOWHERE UNTILL I CONTACTED THEM.Even though it's still under warranty they're unable to replace it with both earpods.","Reviewed in India on 29 December 2023","Low quality product and worst service provider.","1.0 out of 5 stars","","4","Pure White","Without ANC"

I recently bought a headphone from Flipkart and wasn’t satisfied with its bluetooth rangeand quality  so I returned it. The whole return process was so smooth that I hardly had to do anything other than go to their website and click on return. And it was not replacement but refund. Also they don’t ask any questions as long as the product is returned in its proper packaging. In Amazon case, I’ve noticed that you can’t even initiate the process if you don’t have a reason that matches with the choice they provide on their online form.

Upon receiving them, everything seemed to go well until they started to breakdown, one side of the airpods started to emit static noises and soon after stopped working completely.No problem, there's warranty right? Guess what, they decided to send a refurbished item that was either the exact same product I gave them or another defective piece that wasn't working.They will mentally torture you, where you'll spend more money on commute and travel to the service center and you'll end up wasting more money than the actual MRP.In short, don't buy these cheap airpods at whatever cost. They'll eventually fail and you'll regret buying it from a sub-standard company that doesn't care in conducting quality checks when sending under warranty replacements.Edit - 03/04/2023Their customer team is equally clueless. They called me at odd times and then proceeded to tell me, that my earpods would be replaced, and finally, told me that they can't do it as it was outside the warranty period.The airpods that were sent in were completely within warranty. They sent back faulty non-working airpods and right outside the warranty period. They rejected.

Good bass not so great but could go for it if you're not a bass lover.2. Acceptable vocal levels on defaults (if you don't use equalizer).3. Treble is terrible (for real).4. Weight and size are excellent. Sometimes while I almost forget whether I am wearing my earphones because I used to wear over-the-head headphones and recently switched to TWS (spoiler alert: big mistake).5. Charging case is good. Standby time is acceptable at this price range.6. Playback time is as advertised, 6 hours on single charge at 60% volume. This is also acceptable considering the price. Most TWS which offer 6 hours playtime start at 2499/-.Cons:1. I was sleeping on my bed and it slipped right out of my ear. Same thing happened while I was running on a treadmill at the gym. Full disclosure, I was running at 18 kmph on the treadmill. So I'm gonna say not suitable for gym.2. No ANC (active noise cancellation). I guess that's a fair trade at the price range. They gave you 6 hours playback by taking away ANC which costs extra for manufacturing.3. Don't drive your motorcycle wearing these, they will fly away in a second and you won't even notice it. Luckily I did because there was no traffic when I was driving.Overall a good purchase for a casual music listener but not so much into calling.

However, my excitement quickly turned into disappointment when I tried to connect them to my phone. Despite following the instructions carefully, the buds simply would not connect, which was incredibly frustrating.Even when I managed to get them connected, the audio quality left much to be desired. The sound was muddy, lacking clarity, and the ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) feature seemed to have minimal effect, failing to block out the surrounding noise effectively.I had expected a lot more from Boat, given their reputation for quality audio products. Sadly, the Boat 141 ANC buds did not live up to the expectations, and I cannot recommend them based on my experience.I hope this review helps others make an informed decision when considering these earbuds.","Reviewed in India on 10 October 2023","It does not fit in ear , buds are to big","1.0 out of 5 stars","","2","Gunmetal Black","with ANC"

"R27VXCAH9HHSLW","Rishit Bhardwaj","For a reputed company in the buisness of speakers, headphones and sound related products the Airdopes 141 is a huge disaapointment as compared to not only other earbuds of Boat but also as compared to every other truely wireless earbud in the same price range avaialble on Amazon. The product comes in decent packaging in a box small enough to house a pet mollusc or serve as a congested coffin to a dead rodent. The connection quality is only as good as the connection an average lover of these earbuds can make with a woman. The sheer amount of times my music suddenly stopped and the these cheap excuse of a headphones utters its short curse into my ear which represents ""disconnected"". If by an miracle the ear buds manage to stay consistently connected to a mobile for more than 10 minutes they do not work well. It seems the left and right earbud seems to take turns in playing the music. So many times have I found myself willing to smash the charging box because the sound shifts from one earbud to another in fraction of seconds and killing the vibe of music dead. As written in a useless piece of paper called ""manual"" that comes in the box, putting the headphones back in the box closing it and reconnecting after a few seconds is not helpful. The presence of a section based entirely on troubleshooting connection issues speaks a lot about the amount of attention the makers of this abomination gave to actually fixing the problem.Though the headphones deliver decent audio quality while they last but bass remains at an all time low, it is not any use since they do not remain connected. I would absolutely not reccomend any buyer to go for these","Reviewed in India on 14 July 2022","Dissapointing","1.0 out of 5 stars","","13","Bold Black","Without ANC"
"R33NQYNXEXOVF3","sira","I have used this product for 9 months. I have used this product almost everyday. This product isn't great by any stretch. But for the price I didn't expect it to. I was skeptical from the start. I have used this product with utmost care to see how this product performs and lasts.Performance: sound quality is passable for the price. I've had trouble with connecting this earbuds but few times as expected (not a big deal for me).Bulid: Build quality and feel are also passable.Price: 1499 INR (when I purchased)Durability: Here is the biggest fault. This pair lasted me for only 9 months. One side stopped working. I have tried several solutions given online (by BoAt and others) but none of them solved the issue.Verdict: Not worth the money (even compared to xiaomi's sub 500INR wired earphones). I have been using a sub 500INR xiaomi earphones (wired) for more than a year without any issues. I have taken a lot of care so that I do not cause any damage to the earphones. From my experience I would suggest you the consider better earphones (like the sound magic e10c) which are more expensive but are totally worth their price.

"R2LPXZ5Y16OC95","Rachit Pande","Have been using JBL and Sennheiser for ages but finally decided to tryout Boat. The basic purpose of a headphone is good sound and mic probably with noise cancellation and if its wireless then Bluetooth. I draw the line there. All the additional features just adding unnecessary complexities and inconvenience while using this stuff. Touch sensor is not up to the mark of the other two. The sound while different modes are switched (unknowingly) and for low battery just gives your a headache could have been much lite.If you can spend some additional money that I would recommend the other two brands or boat can just do away with all the additional unnecessary feature.

"R30O4VAIR7WRY4","Zecil Jain","Firstly, the delivery was on time and very good. But the real issues started post delivery when I started using the buds. Initially, I noticed there was an issue with my left bud's charging. It didn't charge as quickly as the right bud and more often than not would stop mid song even though my right one would keep going for another 2-3 hours.Next, calling was a sorry experience in itself. People would scream at me for them not being able to hear me almost every time regardless of where I was, be it in a quite room or a busy street. Had to stop using them for calling purposes altogether.Lastly, the sound is ok, I'd even say nearly as good as its described, but there's a persistent issue with the buds. Every time while using my buds, post half hour mark of usage and sometimes in even shorter duration, sound breaks up mid song and flickers in both buds for 10-15 secs continuously which hurts my ear canal very badly and I've to remove them till it stops and returns back to normal.Overall, not at all happy with what I received and I feel like this might be due to fault of the seller and not because of BOAT itself. The seller even refused to replace my product even though its still in the replacement timeline. Really disappointed with Amazon and Appario Business. Won't suggest anyone to go for it or any other product from Appario.#Ripoff","Reviewed in India on 8 August 2023","Calling is not an option, listening music is making me even more miserable!!","2.0 out of 5 stars","","2","Cider Cyan","Without ANC"

Need to put the volume at 100 % in my laptop or phone to hear anything. Useless while riding a two wheeler because of this.2. The plugs don't offer a tight fit. They fall down after 5 min.3. The surface is slippery. The pieces fall down often because of this. It is also difficult to take the item out of the charging case because of this.4. Charging system is cumbersome. First you need to charge the case, then the earphones. Charge drops very quickly. One earphone never gets charge > 10 % now. I am using only right earphone because of this. Tried all manuals, still doesn't work.5.It doesn't connect to a device, unless it has been disconnected from the previous device. This is very annoying.6. Frequent disconnection issues.7.

"RN2D22H0MNWON","Praveen1908E","Pros:1. The level of volume it gets to, is just awesome, it can get incredibly loud so if you're at the gym, these are perfect.2. Awesome Bass!3. Noise cancellation is just great, if you simply put them on without even any music playing, u won't be able to hear things around u very well, it's great for places like Gym.4. Lovely battery life, I've had them a week and only had to charge the case once, that too for just a few minutes. And the earbuds themselves, leave them in case for just five min and you'll be getting battery for a long long while.5. They are very comfortable, can be used for long periods of time.6. Affordable!7. The touch controls are very responsive, tap to pause, double tap right one for next song, double tap left one for either rewind or previous song. Can also pick up calls just by tapping.8. Multiple ear coverings are provided with it.9. Type C portCons:1. The sound quality is not bad or anything but it is slightly muffled as compared to good quality headphones etc. The bass is the highlight so it's great for music, but for movies or gaming, you won't get the most crisp audio.2. Some connectivity issues, sometimes i have to turn my Bluetooth on and off many times for it to work (this is occasional, not a daily or frequent occurrence) [Edit after 1 month use: it's now a very frequent issue]3. The mic quality is good if you are using your phone, but for some reason the quality is really bad if you are on PC4. Sometimes on WhatsApp, the mic will not be detected if you are on call with these earbuds, so you will end up having to take them off to accept a call sometimes. (Not an issue if you are the one dialing) i hope it's just a whatsapp issue rather than earbuds issue.Overall, I needed these for my gym since they play horrible music there (lol) so I'm very very happy with themHighly recommended for music and/or as a more affordable option as compared to JBL etc.edit:I still stand by everything i said but after a month of using these I'm facing a lot of annoying issues.1. They pause music at the slightest of touch when you try to adjust them, but then other times they will ignore the hardest of touch when you are ACTUALLY trying to pause your music. And double tap for next song gesture doesn't work anymore idk why.2. Biggest issue, left ear bud stops charging constantly. My earbuds case is totally clean, but it keeps showing me ""10% battery remaining"" warning on my phone even if i leave this to charge for hours. Right one is just fine but left one just stops charging very often now and it doesn't get fixed for days, i have to hold the earbud down into the case for a long while and even then it can only MAYBE work.3. All the factory reset and all stuff to sort these issues don't work when one of the earbuds is totally dead and unable to charge.4. They are too soft and can easily fall out of ears if you make facial expressions for a minute or two. Only good for gym, bad for content viewing because you might laugh or smile.That's about it but this left earbud not working issue that i keep having is just really annoying. I don't know if this is just my issue with my specific unit though.","Reviewed in India on 1 August 2022","BEST For music!

ENX and ANC are both good and give good noise cancelling on microphone and earphones. I have taken calls from cafeteria and even the most sensitive people didn't complain this time. So 3 starts for 50% purpose met. Unfortunately for music I'll still have to depend on 255 Neo which works better than most premium earphones.I do not understand why Boat could not give same music quality here. Will update and write more once I have used it for considerable amount of time.Update after several days of usage:Major drawbacks -1. There's no volume control on the earphones. To change volume we have to do it only on the phone.2. No dual pairing. So can't connect both laptop and mobile at the same time3. Music quality is outrageously bad. I am forced to use 255 Neo for music.4. Ended up using both earphones. In that respect money is lost.5. Placement of capacitive button is such that we will end up miss touching it several times.6. Battery life is bad. Doesn't last more than 5 hours.Pros :1. EnX works good. Other party hardly hears background noise.2. ANC is pretty good.

"R3IR8C3KUB2XV8","Naman","I recently had purchased these in-ear wireless buds, and I must say, they exceeded my expectations in almost every way.Sound Quality (5/5):The sound quality is where these buds truly shine. The bass is deep and resonant, mids are clear and well-defined, and the highs are crisp without being harsh. Whether I'm listening to my favorite music, podcasts, or watching movies, the audio quality is consistently outstanding. The immersive soundstage they create makes you feel like you're right in the middle of the action.Comfort and Fit (4/5):The buds come with multiple ear tip options, ensuring a snug and comfortable fit for most ear shapes. I found them to be comfortable for extended listening sessions, but they did start to feel slightly uncomfortable after several hours of continuous use. However, this will vary depending on individual preferences and ear shapes.Connectivity and Battery Life (5/5):Pairing these buds with my devices was a breeze, and the Bluetooth connection remained stable even when I moved around my home. The battery life is impressive, providing hours of playback on a single charge. The included charging case is compact and convenient for on-the-go recharging, and it's quick to top up the buds.Touch Controls (4/5):The touch controls on the buds are intuitive and responsive, allowing you to play/pause music, skip tracks, adjust volume, and answer calls with ease. However, I occasionally found accidental taps when adjusting the fit or readjusting the buds, which could be a minor annoyance.Noise Cancellation (4/5):The active noise cancellation (ANC) feature effectively reduces ambient noise, making them great for commuting or blocking out distractions. While it's not on par with over-ear ANC headphones, it does a commendable job considering their size.Overall, these in-ear wireless buds offer a premium audio experience, comfortable fit, and solid battery life. They're perfect for daily use, workouts, and travel, delivering impressive sound quality that rivals many over-ear headphones. While they may not be the absolute best in every category, they strike an excellent balance that should satisfy most users. If you're in the market for high-quality wireless buds, these are definitely worth considering.","Reviewed in India on 10 September 2023","Exceptional In-Ear Wireless Buds for an Immersive Audio Experience","5.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61IGRoWGG+L.jpg

"RS0C6181WUTDZ","Mcgonagal S.V","I had to exchange the product because the first order was delivered with a defective product. The Left pod was not working, which was presumably normal since a lot of the consumers faced it as well. It was correctable, there were lots of videos on YT guiding us on how to connect both sides with 5 taps on both the sensors at the same time. However, no matter how many times and whatever methods I tried my left side simply was not working, no music was being played. I thought perhaps there was something wrong with my device as well or that the pods did not match with my device. Then I realized that the left sensor was working, I could play and pause the music (The right side was playing the music perfectly fine). So, I figure that it was not about connection but that the left side was a defect. The very same day the order was delivered, I placed my grievances and scheduled for a replacement with both the pods working.I got my exchanged product just after 2 days with no issues or hardships.Although, I was disappointed with the first experience the 2nd experience was a saving grace with good services by both parties, i.e the company & delivery agent/agency.Now, about the product in talk.Pros:- Good bass, super long battery life, fast connection, fast charging, I got the cyan+grey combo so the colour is unique & refreshing, it's rather comfortable even after long usage and the sensors are rightly sensitive enough.Cons:- I suppose not the best noise cancellation (3/5) and average call quality. For the extra ears rubbers, I got their single pieces, not in pairs so I'm not quite sure if that's normal or if there has been an error in pairing them. I don't know what to do with single pairs in different sizes, it's rather funny.As someone who barely talks on the phone, I don't really mind the avg. call quality, I can live with it. Same with the noise cancellation(3/4), I don't prioritise that. I want to hear if someone is calling me. I prioritise battery life & bass/sound quality the most and those were delivered so 5 stars it is.I suppose the review is subjected to what one prioritises the most.For the price, the quality is on par with it. If you want super-duper quality in all the fields then I'd suggest you be ready to pay higher instead of paying a lower price and being so disappointed with it.","Reviewed in India on 15 August 2022","2nd time was the charm.","5.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519P1OGIqeL.jpg","4","Cider Cyan","Without ANC"
