"R259V1H8TBEFMN","Shivalik Halder","I have been using the Oneplus Buds Z2 for more than a 1.5 years now and that is perhaps the best TWS headphones at that given price. It has great features, great sound, great battery life and good noise cancellation. But I was still searching for another TWS. Why? Because I am not a fan of bass. My only two reasons for not liking the Buds Z2 is that it is bass heavy, and it is too loud. This is what most people want, but my music preferences are not like that. So when I read reviews about the Sony WF C500, I thought of buying it. But that changed was that I got the Song WF C700N at under 5000 in the Great Indian Festival. And what impressed me most the most is the sound. The sound isn‚Äôt too bassy. It balanced. Some might call it flat and boring too. Because it won‚Äôt excite you if you are someone who loves bass. But I loved the sound. I was amazed what a 5 mm dynamic driver could do. Yes, small driver means the volume isn‚Äôt as loud as Oneplus, but I could never use the Oneplus over 20 percent volume as it would hurt my ears. The Sony is much more soft and has a warm sound tone. It packs good punch and if you want you have a full equaliser at your disposal in the Headphones Connect app. And you can play along with the already created profiles or make custom ones. Adjust the sound to your likings and you will be amazed at the sound. The connection is easy too and the app is easy to use. I would say for the price I got it at, the sound punches much above the class.But that‚Äôs about it. If you look for features, look away. The buds have a continuous battery backup of around 8 hours approximately and the case holds one additional charge. You will get approximately 16 hours of playtime with ANC turned on. The case takes 3 hours ro fully charge however there is a fast charge feature where you can charge for 10 mis and use for some 2-4 hours. There are no touch controls, however the buttons are very tactile and a breeze to use. The buds have IPX4 though. And it is one of the lightest set of TWS I have ever used. So don‚Äôt look for any features. As the competition offer much more at lesser price.But that I loved, I will repeat again, is the sound. And the customisation available for the sound. The experience is premium. The connection is easy for both Android and iOS. For someone who loves to play around with different types of music, this is a great pair of TWS if you get it under 6000 I would say. This would be an audiophile‚Äôs dream budget TWS if you look at it that way. But it for the amazing sound and nothing else.","Reviewed in India on 10 October 2023","Premium sound and that‚Äôs all there is to offer","5.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cpAPs-0mL.jpg","47","Black","WF-C700N"

"RWQJMLFYBAIMT","Amazon Customer","After 10 days of use, in my opinion these are a good pair of earbuds in terms of sound quality. The body doesn't look premium to me even though the original price is of the premium range.Sound wise it performs decent. It fits well. You can even try head banging, it wouldn't get off.Few issues I found:1. I have used premium ear buds which have the touch/pinch feature to operate on the media playing on the device, and they didn't respond many times to the touch and i feel the tactile button on the earbuds is a good replacement for that. In general, there is no problem with the buttons, but you cant lie down sideways as there are chances that the button will squeeze between your head and pillow, thus pausing the media or whatever you set as the button action.2. Comfort: I have used OnePlus pro ear buds which i could wear all day, but this one, i cant. I dont think i can wear it even for an hour without taking them off. It doesn't hurt a lot, but I can certainly feel some discomfort. If you are someone who would wear them all them all day, then it might not be for you.","Reviewed in India on 8 November 2023","Decent earbuds","4.0 out of 5 stars","","2","Black","WF-C700N"

"R246Z9Q1U9SFR3","KAUSHIK","It is the first time in my life I've considered a bluetooth earphone. Received the product. Unboxed it, read the manual, paired it with phone. No trouble. Sound is standard issue, as claimed on the detailed reviews on internet. Nothing extraordinary.I check the range on first day, around 10 metres after which the audio starts breaking. Used it for 3 days without any issues, both the units working and battery charging as usual.After 3 days, the right bud disconnects randomly. Try pressing the button on it but no play/pause response on phone. I notice that it said ""power o...power o...power o..."". It couldn't successfully power on or connect to bluetooth. Put it in the case for a minute and it was good. Also that day the right unit began losing signal suddenly, despite being within 2 or 3 metres of the phone, line of sight being unblocked. I thought maybe it happens in bluetooth earphones and isn't a big issue.The issue amplified in the upcoming days. The right unit kept losing signal and kept powering off itself randomly, sometimes it could power on sometimes it couldn't.Today, it couldn't even power on after putting it in case. All I could hear is a static sound coming on and off in a few seconds from the right unit, its trying to do something but it isnt succeeding.I brought it for Rs 5666 in Feb 2023 from seller Appario. I've ordered several items from them in the past and they've not let me down.I've concluded that this unit is a bust. Bad luck, I got a lemon. Should have doubted that something is wrong with it when it was selling for a discount. There are manufacturing issues with 1 to 5% of the products, that's how good things are manufactured these days, so when you end up with something defective it's a sour experience. And before you ask, I've been taking great care of them by not wearing them in weird places like toilet and shower.Warranty is a thorny road, and so is replacement. The amount of red tape surrounding warranty is obnoxious. Since I trusted Sony name I took a chance that these units will last but they didnt and my chance for asking a replacement gone. Got no other option other than biting the bullet and eat the cost. Even if I get a replacement, this lemon is going to end up in refurbished market where some other poor fellow would buy this sour lemon again and get his taste soury.Bottom line- be ready to eat the cost of product in case it's a lemon, don't rely on warranty and replacement policies because they are always tipped in favour of the seller/manufacturer.Update: Made up my mind to dispose it off. Know your place, trash!","Reviewed in India on 6 March 2023","Got a short fused lemon, otherwise good","2.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51FwsxzXWqL.jpg

"R3DZBZ95AL5J5F","Akhil","Pros:Sound 4/5Comfort 5/5Anc:4/5Connecitivity : 4/5Sound profile is the best in the segment after you tweak some settings in the Sony headphone app. The 'excited' option in equalizer sounded best to me. Although you could get even better after you adjust equalizer. And I preferred sound quality over connecitivity in the settings. Voice prompt turned off.Con:Battery: Only issue I'm facing is that the earbuds charging is stuck at 100 and not draining. I've been using it for atleast 3 hours a day but the battery won't drop. However initially the left ear bud was showing uneven battery drain, it went from 100 to 20 in less than 45 mins.  Hopefully I get the product replaced from Sony. Will update .Update: (14-08-13) Apparently the battery drain in left earbud was evident only when connected to tv. The battery being stuck at 100 resolved on it's own. Not sure why it happened. However I haven't decided on whether to get this replaced. Shall update.","Reviewed in India on 9 August 2023","Perfect earbuds!","4.0 out of 5 stars","","24","Lavender","WF-C700N"

"R1RF5ABI2LCTLI","dvn","This is a well built, good sounding pair of wireless earphones for the price (I got them for around 3,500 with offers) from a reputable brand. The battery lasts forever one on charge, which is useful for me as I spend long hours on my computer or phone every day for work. All I have to do is put them back in the little box and charge the whole thing before I go to bed. The mic quality isn't as good as other (pricier) earphones but is a noticeable upgrade on your phone's mic for video conferencing, so good enough for me.They actually sound surprisingly good for the price. Can't really compare with airpods or good over-ear headphones but I don't really think the drop in quality is that big of a deal. These are well made. My only real gripe about these earphones is that they aren't the most comfortable to wear. The left side is fine, but for me the right seems just a little uncomfortably large. It starts to hurt after an hour if I have it sitting in snugly. This could just be a me problem, as I haven't extensively used other in-ear wireless buds before, but maybe something to keep in mind for you.

"RSKH8ZQS5H0TJ","Adithyan S R","Well...there's so many negative reviews here and people are even comparing these to Boat and what not ü§¶First of all...it's a Sony .. I've been a Sony user for ages .. I've been using MHC-V71D since 2018... And guess what ..this small buds is providing the same quality and functionality as that of the ‚Çπ40 K party speaker...So talking about the positives :1. Sony Connect App : If you really are an audiophile this app is an essential tool.. like I said ..we can choose a range of preset sound fields (or create custom ones) on the app...and yes...it will take some time to get used to one..once thats set then its üí•  ...( I suggest switching it into ""Excited"" sound field , which has equal amount of bass and vocal quality  )2. Battery Life : it does what it claims ..using it for 4.5 hours continuously causes only 30% fall in battery.3. Design : it looks premium...feels premium..and build quality is evident.. the magnet is too strong...you can feel it ...the buds won't fall off from the case no matter what..4. Sound signature : one must really try the 360 reality audio inorder to feel the difference between normal stereo and spatial audio ...it picks even the smallest sounds from every corner and provides an enriched ambient sound..the vocals are crisp...bass is sufficient .. overall sound quality is worth the price5. Comfort : talking about comfort ..yes...it's comfortable for long hour use ..the max time I spend on it was for 6 hours and I didn't felt any pain/fatigue or anything6. Bluetooth connectivity : once paired the buds will connect the moment you take it out of the case...and you will get an uninterrupted quality connection over long distancesNow let's talk about the ok-ok part :1. Fit : the buds feels really tucked into the ears and yes there's set of different sizes in the box ...but I constantly feel like they may fall off  ( I tried to intentionally make it fall off by shaking my head and doing things but it didn't fell off...but I do have a fear that it may fall off )2. Material : The material and colour looks cool in real life...but if your are opting for the light coloured versions (green/orange/white) you should always be aware to keep your fingers clean...or otherwise the buds will somewhat attract anything that's on your hand ( and yes you can easily wipe it off and clean it ..but I prefer not to make them dirty as it may in the long run ruin the colour)Ok...now to the negatives1. Mic quality : call quality is great ...but it'll feel somewhat ok...the reason : the mic picks up each and every sound around you ....so if you are having a conversation in a closed environment with minimal noise then the quality will be good... otherwise in outdoor conditions it's not that great  ..and I don't prefer these ones for professional meeting stuffs or anything like that because of the above said factors....and don't even think about using this as a mic for recording ...2. The ""Hissss"" : well it's not distracting for me ..you can hear it...you can feel it...but it won't be a nuisance ...atleast for me ... After using for some days you won't even notice it that much3. Latency : sometimes can feel a small delay..and it's not that much distractingSo that's all about thisAnd let me tell you who should get this :Anyone who needs a high quality ambient sound experience in a small packageThose whos lazy to charge it every once and thenArtists/Students/WFH/or anybody who needs uninterrupted music for hoursMovie watching buddiesSomeone who mostly have conversations in a somewhat silent environment ie, indoorsAnd those who shouldn't buy this :Professionals with meetings and calls throughout the whole day who have to attend calls at everywhereVloggers who's planning to use this as a micThe Outdoor peopleThose who don't even know the difference between a mono and stereo ü§∑ü§¶So that's all about the WF-C500THANK YOU !!","Reviewed in India on 21 February 2022","READ THIS IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY !","4.0 out of 5 stars","","2","Orange","WF-C500/Orange"
"R38KTWSJNXRYAT","Anup Singh","I wanted to buy wireless earbuds for under Rs. 2500/- but after doing so much research I found that the earbuds that come under Rs. 2500 (like, Oneplus earbuds, Oppo earbuds, etc.) were not giving me features that I was looking for and that was Great Sound.Under Rs.2500 earbuds were giving other features like Noise Cancellation, long battery life, etc., etc. But they were not giving a sound experience. Even expensive Samsung did not give that sound experience that Sony gives.It was out of my budget but somehow I managed to buy it and now I can say it was a great decision to buy these earbuds.I only recommend this for Sound Quality.

"R19CSCEBHH3B0F","Mohit","The product is good for sound quality. I have tested it with iPad and Android phone and it works a little better with iPad on Spotify and Apple music. Actually it works great with Apple music because they have lossless audio quality.If you are buying these earbuds then you would have to get the subscription of either the apple music or Spotify, otherwise it won't be able to give that great clear sound quality.As far as call quality is concerned, not to buy this if call quality is in your priority list. Call quality is okay okay.Gaming... I don't play game so, I don't know.No issues while watching movies or watching YouTube.Build quality... I think it's great üëç, it should last more than 5 years easily.Battery... For me it's greatüëç. I can easily go more than a week without changing it. But I don't listen often. Basically if you use 2 hours daily for combined usages then it should last you a week atleast.EQ app ( sony connect ) is actually good. You can tune things accordingly to your taste and songs. Like for old songs you can set the pre set ""vocals"" that would erase the base and will give clear vocals, you can also choose pre set ""bright"" that would give you vocals and awesome instrument separation, and for other I prefer ""excited"" preset. This one gives balance of everything with a little more emphasis on the bass. You can make your own presets in the App.About 360 audio, nothing special and don't think about it as Spatial audio of Apple ( though I haven't heard it ) but I know this 360 is not comparable to Spatial audio. To put it simply, it just the Dolby Atmos sound quality ( that surround sound quality) again you need music of that sound quality for that. I personally didn't like 360 audio and I just don't get it why the hell it even exist? ?? ü§î.Ohh I forgot to tell you about convenience. Yess you will get that airpods like convenience if you chose buy these earbuds. Actually, I have sony xb-400 ( that neckband earphones ).The biggest issue I faced with xb - 400 , is that they always get entangled and you always need to be careful about the wire. Also the whole experience of using it is trouble some. You need to press the botton to switch on the Bluetooth in the earphones and then you need to switch on the Bluetooth of your phone and then try to connect it ( often it doesn't get connected by itself) so you need to go to the settings in your phone then in Bluetooth and then it can get connected. Sometimes I had to restart my phone.But in this earbuds, I just take them out put it in my ear then it automatically get connected. I don't have to do anything it works üòÉ like magic. ( Though you just need to let the Bluetooth of your phone open all time.) It doesn't eat lot of battery, I have checked it, it's almost negligible.Now that's called convenience üòÖ. And it does feel like money spent well.üòÉOverall, if you want the great sound quality with awesome bass. You can easily pick these earbuds, and you won't regret it.Don't buy neckbands, they are outdated and not contemporary to the current lifestyle. It's a fact because wherever you see, people are using earbuds not neckband or earphones.","Reviewed in India on 17 November 2022","Buy only for sound quality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","","137","Orange","WF-C500/Orange"

The clarity is very nice with apple music..but i can relate nice difference between wired [non-noice-cancelled] earphones [not even buds]. So if you are buying this after using boat or any headphones, you will love this..if you have known apple or any similar experience, then you will see it little average. For some reason, not able to connect this with my laptop on both linux as well as windows, Instead of spending 2.5k on boat, spending 2k more for this is definitely a good choice.","Reviewed in India on 17 December 2023","Good one for the price.

It sounds like you were expecting more features, such as noise cancellation and better microphone quality, for the price you paid.In terms of comfort, it's not uncommon for some people to find in-ear headphones uncomfortable after extended use, so that may be a personal preference.If you purchased the headphones from a Sony showroom, you may want to consider reaching out to their customer support to see if they can offer any solutions or assistance. Additionally, you can try reaching out to Sony's online support or forums to see if other users have experienced similar issues and if they have found any solutions or workarounds.If you're still not satisfied with the headphones and within the return window, you can consider returning them for a refund or exchange.kakde brother'sRephrase it as a worse review Recently I bought Sony WF c500 headphones but I am not satisfied with the purchase not worth to money no voice cancellation features at this price very disappointing and the mic does not catch voice while driving but good in connectivity not comfortable in the ear after 10 to 15 mins.after a 1-month use review, I bought it from the Sony showroom also I need to charge not as excepted.My experience with the Sony WF c500 headphones has been quite disappointing. Despite the high price, they don't seem to be worth the money as they lack noise cancellation features and the microphone quality is poor, making it difficult to use while driving. While the connectivity is good, the headphones are not comfortable to wear for more than 10-15 minutes. After using them for a month, I regret my decision to purchase them from the Sony showroom. Additionally, the battery life is not as expected, requiring frequent charging.kakde brother'sMake more descriptive and with feelings My experience with the Sony WF c500 headphones has been quite disappointing. Despite the high price, they don't seem to be worth the money as they lack noise cancellation features and the microphone quality is poor, making it difficult to use while driving. While the connectivity is good, the headphones are not comfortable to wear for more than 10-15 minutes. After using them for a month, I regret my decision to purchase them from the Sony showroom. Additionally, the battery life is not as expected, requiring frequent charging.I must say that my experience with the Sony WF c500 headphones has been incredibly underwhelming, and it's left me feeling rather disappointed. Despite the high price tag, I can't help but feel that they aren't worth the money at all, especially considering that they lack essential features like noise cancellation. The microphone quality is also extremely poor, making it almost impossible to use the headphones while driving or engaging in any other activity that requires hands-free communication.Although the headphones have good connectivity, they fall short in terms of comfort. After wearing them for only 10-15 minutes, I feel a significant amount of discomfort, which only gets worse with time. It's almost as if the headphones were designed to prioritize aesthetics over functionality.Regrettably, my decision to purchase the headphones from the Sony showroom has only compounded my frustration. To add insult to injury, the battery life is not as advertised, and I find myself having to charge the headphones frequently.All in all, I'm deeply dissatisfied with my experience with the Sony WF c500 headphones, and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.","Reviewed in India on 4 April 2023","Disappointing Experience with Sony WF c500 Headphones: Not Worth the High Price Tag","2.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+liUd30bL.jpg","0","Black","WF-C500/Black"

"R1VXE1YOO4ETJB","Jatinder Aggarwal","I have purchased this product a month back and it's definitely not the product that I expected from Sony.It has inherent technical issues, like keep getting disconnected from one earbud. This is the issue because they have the functionality that o ly 1 earbud can work. However the moment you get another sound, either call or message tone or any other app tone, it will be disconnected and then only one earbud will connect back.Even if both the earbuds are connected then also it keep getting disconnected and reconnecting automatically very frequently, I am not able to use these earbuds at all.I tried replacement from Amazon but they are not able to do because 1 month is passed.I tried Sony customer care but they said they can't do anything as you haven't purchased it from us. You can go to service center and try to get these repaired there. Which is very unprofessional from both Amazon dn Sony.How can they sell faulty products like this.Now, in the quality of the sound, it's worst than any of the true wireless earbud that I have purchased. This is the 3rd one. Other are even half the price of this, like from Mi or OnePlus and have much better sound quality.This is very expensive product and not worth the money. If you want to spend equal money go for OnePlus or better spend some more money and buy Bose.Sony India is making all of there products in India very cheap quality and not the same what it used to be earlier. When it was made in Japan.It's also very heavy, do not fit the ear and keep getting dropped. I am sure this product will be getting discounted very soon.Call quality is just not usable, even in the very quite place, other person is not able to hear your voice.I am very surprised how others have given good rating to this product, either it's a marketing fraud or some fake reviews.Don't buy this product, it's pure waste of money.","Reviewed in India on 2 November 2022","Do not buy this product, it has technical issues","1.0 out of 5 stars","","14","Green","WF-C500"
"R37KAWB87QFD9","Rahul","Review:I had high hopes for the Sony WF-C500 earphones, but my experience with them has been nothing short of a nightmare. Not only did the charging case heat up to dangerous levels, causing it to melt, but now the earbuds themselves refuse to charge. It's clear that Sony's quality control has taken a nosedive, and their customer service is equally disappointing.First and foremost, let's address the most alarming issue: the charging case. Imagine my shock when I noticed that it was emitting excessive heat while charging, and before I knew it, the case had melted! I can't stress enough how dangerous this situation is. Sony, a reputed company, should have implemented strict safety measures to prevent such hazards. I shudder to think of the potential consequences if I hadn't been around to notice the overheating. It's simply unacceptable.Naturally, I immediately reached out to Sony's customer service, hoping for a swift resolution. However, instead of offering a prompt replacement or refund, they had the audacity to demand 1490 rupees from me! Seriously? It's as if they're trying to profit from their own product's failure. Charging customers for a defective product is nothing short of extortion.To add insult to injury, their warranty claim process is a convoluted mess. They've made it intentionally difficult to navigate, likely hoping that frustrated customers will simply give up and purchase a new set of earphones instead. It's a shameful tactic, and it reeks of a company that cares more about their bottom line than the satisfaction and safety of their customers.I'm deeply disappointed.","Reviewed in India on 13 July 2023","Divice calling experience is not good and most important pathetic customer service","1.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51aC73NzwyL.jpg","8","Black","WF-C500/Black"
"R2L17O5QV0GK36","Veera Raghavan","I had used the product for listening to music, attending meetings over my laptop & phone. It functioned well with good sound.However, like all good things, it came to an end abruptly, in about 1 year. One of the earbud stopped functioning (got into a boot loop with repeated 'Power On' message). The internet is littered with such issues with this and other Sony earbuds.Additional surprise - the service center reported that this is a non-repairable product. And considering the product was just out of warranty (about a month or so), the only they could do is talk to the management and offer a discount on repurchase of the product. Submitted the product with the service center and awaiting response.Updated response from Sony - They are willing to provide a 50% discount on the MRP if I was interested in repurchasing it. That is around Rs 4,5000  (this is already more than what is listed in Amazon)My tip - save the money, buy a cheap headphone if you are not a audiophile or a buy a product that offers bullet proof warranty for at least 2-3 years. For reference, my OnePlus Wireless Z earphone lasted around 2 years of rugged usage, before it gave up. But it was around 3rd the price of this one.","Reviewed in India on 14 July 2023","Good but only while it lasted","1.0 out of 5 stars","","3","Black","WF-C500/Black"

Over the build quality is fantastic. The materials used are high quality and they seem like a pair which are designed to last. When it comes to ergonomics, they fit pretty snug in my ears and they don't poke out. But this may vary based on the shape and size of your ears. Over all, I find the find extremely comfortable and snug.Now, coming to best feature of these buds, the sound. Short answer, they are the best sounding earphones in this price range. You can compare them to any other TWS in the same price bracket and you'll end up picking these every time. They are that good. The fidelity of the sound is immense, there is no boost on particular frequency, overall well balanced sound which you can tweak through the app.Battery life is fairly decent, I charge it once or max twice a week and these have given me no problem.The worst part about these buds are the mic quality. It's straight up bad.

But I have no regrets. 2 of my friends bought boat tws recently. One of them has weird latency issues where even youtube audio/video don't sync up and the other friend's earbud stopped working after 1 month ( only has one functioning earbud left)About the Sony WF- C500, the sound is crisp and clean. You can customize it according to your taste and preference, there's an app for it.The build quality is good and it feels sturdy. It fits perfectly in my ears with 0 chance of falling out accidentally. The fit is so snug that it kind of acts like noise cancelation.The microphone is also very good. It does pick up a lot of background noise however which is still manageable.The connectivity is very fast and you can also just use one earphone at a time with full functionality.Both earbuds have tactile buttons which are superior to touch gestures in my opinion.It doesn't have any unnecessary gimmicks or unwanted features. The earbuds do what they're supposed to do.One interesting thing I would like to point out is the the latency. I honestly did not expect it would be so good. I play Valorant competitive a lot and I used the earbuds during my climb from Platinum to Diamond.I noticed almost perfect latency. Had no issues during my gameplay.Overall I'd say if you're buying it for around 3k it's a solid buy. I see a lot of reviewers talking about it's case being plastic and no appealing. For someone who only cares about the buds and audio quality. The case really doesn't matter and it's not like its ugly or something. I honestly like it.

Please use official sony app to adjust eq. I am using excited as it gives a fine balance between bass and treble.2. Super stable bluetooth connection unless there are room walls in between which will drop the signal a bit. However this will happen with jabra elite 4 also so no worries.3. Crisp differentials between chords, high and medium notes. Listening to instrument heavy arrangements is a pure bliss here. Can‚Äôt complain about edm too.4. Call quality: honestly ifbyou wish to use this as wfh instrument where you are in your room and for obvious reasons you have a quite surrounding then no worry. You can hear the other side well. They can hear you loud and clear. Only issue will happen when you are outside as it will pick noise very well. However this has been clearly explained by sony so got to give some brownie points to them on this.Verdict: For any audiophile, sony should be the one stop shop.

The shape of the case is very small and compact, easy to carry.5. The buds are very light weight, even in continous usage ear doesn't pain.Cons1.

Audio quality is almost equivalent as wired earphones quality , mic is decent for calls , not much optimised during calls in traffic .Fitting is superb just select right buds in the boxApp support is excellentVery good for wearing for longer times and watching movies alsoCons:It doesn‚Äôt has touch controls , it has button controls , still works very accurate but u can‚Äôt customise it those r fixed , I tried hard for changing in app but I did not getApp is not much user friendlyThat‚Äôs it ! Overall music quality is simple voww","Reviewed in India on 14 April 2023","Original music and masterpiece at this price","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Black","WF-C500/Black"
"RLPZRNCE9MMOL","Amazon Customer","Hi. I've tried multiple brands earbuds like OnePlus realme JBL and now here I am with Sony. All i can say is WOW. I am an audiophile (kind of) so I really need the music to sound the best it can and after sampling OnePlus and realme let me assure you those are not for people who appreciate music the way it is. OnePlus and realme have boosted bass to oblivion making everything sound suppressed and muddy. We don't need that neither do you if you're seeing this. Sony has mastered the audio imaging in this. They have manage to bring out every beat perfectly to us. Honestly I haven't experienced anything better than Sony's sound quality so far and the music I've been listening for years now feels soo much more than what is was. The depthness the beats that were missed the low background Shills everything I can listen to it now. I am extremely satisfied with sound quality. As for Noise cancellation. You get the passive Cancellation i.e. they're cupped to your ears in such a way that it's basically like ANC. And trust me ANC is overrated if you're not going for airpods or something around that price tag don't even think that ANC you're getting is worth anything.the app itself is soo immersive with all the audio modes but I prefer excited or bass boosted mostly so yea. That's thatNo cons so far","Reviewed in India on 5 June 2022","This Buds are NOT for an average Indian","5.0 out of 5 stars","","16","Green","WF-C500"
"RVUWU0ULO17E8","FL√ïW√äRH√òRN","I am very much satisfied with my Sony WF-C500.Earlier I had three pairs of Senheiser CX 180 and two pairs of  SONY XB 450 one with mic and another without mic.I have a misconception that TWS are no nearer to a Wired one  because so far I have used a variety of TWS(my friend's one).Eventhough while buying Sony TWS I have a lot in my list like Jabra elite series,JBL 230 & Wave buds, Oppo enco air 2 pro,OnePlus series and last but not least SONY'S its own competitor XB700.As Iam a basshead,always I want deep bass without suprassing others.Another great compliement from SONY is that C500 have SONY'S HEADPHONE APP support.Surely Mate,IF you are an audiophile who loves to hear each and every Sound then U should blindly go for this because there is no other TWS in market no where near closer to this one even the pricer ones too.","Reviewed in India on 25 March 2023","Damn SOUNDüñ§ And An ABS√ïLUT√ä BL√éSS","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Orange","WF-C500/Orange"
"R3JPR1N5VQ89TN","Anikesh Kumar","This is a genuine review by me. I haven't expected that product will be this good. Really this is an amazing TWS in this budget segment. I bought this for under 4k. The sound quality is up to the mark. I have Sony XM910n headphones and I can say these have better sound than my 12k headphones. Everything is perfect. And talking about comfort. I heard some international reviewer have a little complaint about comfort but this fit well in my ear and I can wear it for a long. I'm a student and I was searching for this type of earphone for a long and now my search is over. The battery is good and connectivity is also fine. If you're getting this under 5k, then you can go for it.","Reviewed in India on 12 April 2023","Unexpected Performance!!!

"R2DZP0IT1VPTPF","AM","I have been a Sony user for Audio-Visual for decades now. So, I know what to expect from Sony product. Though I have used other brands of earphones and headphones  viz. JBL, Boat, Philips, Apple,......In short, I got what I expected.I use this item for my official meetings connected to my laptop. Sound and Mic quality is just great at least for meetings and while in a closed room (No background sounds/noise). As the mic seems to be too sensitive in picking up everything even the minute ones, may not be good for outdoor/public places.I am not a person who uses headphones/earbuds for entertainment purpose, so I would refrain from commenting on the quality with respect to entertainment (Music/Movies).Use one or both buds, starts as you pull it/them out of the case. Long running.Wireless ear pods/buds, by design, are kind of vulnerable to misplacing. We must be careful to place it back in the case when not in use. I feel not to use it while in motion (Walking, Running, Jumping etc. especially while outdoors), feels like they will fall out, though they have not as yet. :)Will update the review if I get to know any other aspect in due course of my usage.","Reviewed in India on 17 October 2022","Great Product as Expected from Sony","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Black","WF-C500/Black"
"R3MS56185BT3U6","Vaikunth Bhandare","Really love them.At the money i.e 3k these are next level earphones. Mind it you wont get deep bass or anc at this price but what they mentioned they check all the ticks with being super light and comfy and real good music & immersive movie experience.  I own XM3 & XM4 which are much premium offerings and on sound level aren't comparable to this one, but these tiny C500 beat both of them in terms of battery so hands down to the offering on that particular spec.","Reviewed in India on 2 August 2023","Great budget truly wireless earphones","5.0 out of 5 stars","","2","Black","WF-C500/Black"
"RUML6EMPI3ZMS","Hardik Gehlot","I bought them for around 3500‚Çπ and at this price these are best. Other TWS from JBL and Boat doesn‚Äôt come close and the Sony headphone app provides a really good customisation. They don‚Äôt have ANC but due to their tight fit it feels like ANC always on. It only has one problem, due to tight fit ear hurts after wearing for longer time like 2+ hours but below that time these are amazing.","Reviewed in India on 22 July 2023","Best TWS at this price","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Green","WF-C500"
