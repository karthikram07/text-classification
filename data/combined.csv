R259V1H8TBEFMN,Shivalik Halder,"I have been using the Oneplus Buds Z2 for more than a 1.5 years now and that is perhaps the best TWS headphones at that given price. It has great features, great sound, great battery life and good noise cancellation. But I was still searching for another TWS. Why? Because I am not a fan of bass. My only two reasons for not liking the Buds Z2 is that it is bass heavy, and it is too loud. This is what most people want, but my music preferences are not like that. So when I read reviews about the Sony WF C500, I thought of buying it. But that changed was that I got the Song WF C700N at under 5000 in the Great Indian Festival. And what impressed me most the most is the sound. The sound isn‚Äôt too bassy. It balanced. Some might call it flat and boring too. Because it won‚Äôt excite you if you are someone who loves bass. But I loved the sound. I was amazed what a 5 mm dynamic driver could do. Yes, small driver means the volume isn‚Äôt as loud as Oneplus, but I could never use the Oneplus over 20 percent volume as it would hurt my ears. The Sony is much more soft and has a warm sound tone. It packs good punch and if you want you have a full equaliser at your disposal in the Headphones Connect app. And you can play along with the already created profiles or make custom ones. Adjust the sound to your likings and you will be amazed at the sound. The connection is easy too and the app is easy to use. I would say for the price I got it at, the sound punches much above the class.But that‚Äôs about it. If you look for features, look away. The buds have a continuous battery backup of around 8 hours approximately and the case holds one additional charge. You will get approximately 16 hours of playtime with ANC turned on. The case takes 3 hours ro fully charge however there is a fast charge feature where you can charge for 10 mis and use for some 2-4 hours. There are no touch controls, however the buttons are very tactile and a breeze to use. The buds have IPX4 though. And it is one of the lightest set of TWS I have ever used. So don‚Äôt look for any features. As the competition offer much more at lesser price.But that I loved, I will repeat again, is the sound. And the customisation available for the sound. The experience is premium. The connection is easy for both Android and iOS. For someone who loves to play around with different types of music, this is a great pair of TWS if you get it under 6000 I would say. This would be an audiophile‚Äôs dream budget TWS if you look at it that way. But it for the amazing sound and nothing else.",Reviewed in India on 10 October 2023,Premium sound and that‚Äôs all there is to offer,5.0 out of 5 stars,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cpAPs-0mL.jpg,47,Black,WF-C700N,sony,,

R3RE38OETKXLGF,Kuldeep Kumar,"First of all I am writing this review after using these extensively for about 8 months and I was so impressed with the overall sound quality, functionality and battery backup of these TWS that I bought three of these. Two from amazon and one from offline market.PROS1. Sound Quality: The sound quality is great for this budget. You will enjoy watching movies and listening to songs on these. The trebble is good so you will hear the dialogs very clearly. Base is decent at this price point but don‚Äôt expect them to be too good on the base as these are budget TWS but again the sound is great for what you are paying for.2. Battery Backup: For this budget the battery backup on these tiny things is outstanding. You can easily watch a full 3.5 to 4 hour movie without worrying that the battery will die. Infact, I have even used these straight for more than 4 hours and its battery never gave up on me. Adding to that, the case itself has its own battery so the buds will charge as soon as you put them back in the case so basically the battery lasts for more than a week if you use them daily on regular basis for 3-4 hours daily.3. Durability: After using them for about 8 months I can assure you that these will not fail on you and are very durable. All three of them which I bought are working fine without any issues. I also suggested them to some of my friends and collegues and their TWS are also working fine till date.4. Touch Sensors: You get touch sensors on each of the buds which you can use to play, pause, skip tracks, next and previous songs in the list, picking up calls etc.5. Latency: On normal mode I didn‚Äôt find them lagging behind but if you want to use them for gaming with super low latency then it comes with something called ‚ÄòBEAST MODE‚Äô which further improves latency but at the cost of faster battery drain. So you can definitely use them for gaming. To switch to ‚ÄòBeast Mode‚Äô just tap thrice on the touch sensors on any of the buds.6. Size: These are tiny. You can see the photo where I have put them besides a AA battery to have an idea of their size. So you can put these in your pocket without making them bulky. These are super portable.7. USB C Charging: These have a USB C port for charging so you can charge these easily with your phone charger. You can also find a USB A to C charging cable inside the box.8. Connectivity: Pairing these with your phone is super simple and quick. The phone remembers the connection so when you turn your Bluetooth on next time it will connect automatically to these. Moreover, you can use only one bud at a time and keep the other one in the case and later one if you do decide to use both then you can simple take out the other one from the case and it will connect automatically with the one already connected to your phone.9. Different size ear plugs: These also comes with different size ear plugs so you can pick one that fits your ears for better comfort.10. Fast charging: Once you put the earbuds inside the case they charge real fast so even if they run out of battery (which they don‚Äôt, trust me) you can charge them up in just 5 minutes for almost an hour of playback.11. Battery level LEDs: The case have four LEDs on the front that shows you the battery level and charging status. You can also see the battery percentage of the buds on the phone when they are connected to it.CONS:1. Build: Though the build is very good, out of three I bought two of them came with a loose cap that was a little wobbly. Though the wobble was very minimum but still I felt that the build quality is not consistent.2. Less Base: The base not these TWS is not that great but as I said these are budget TWS that comes with decent base for the price.3. Range: The range is surely not their strength. You will loose connection if you go far from your source OR will experience sound drop if anything like wall etc. comes between these TWS and the source. But if you are sitting close to the source with clear line of sight in 3-5 m radius then you will have best connection without any signal drops. Additionally I also experienced signal drops when they have almost 20 to 30% battery left so make sure you keep the buds and case charged above these levels.4. Not for workouts: These will slip from your ears if you use them for intense workouts or jogging as they don‚Äôt have the ear hooks.5. Battery percentage: You cannot see the exact battery percentage for the case as it does not have a display.6. USB C Cable: The supplied USB C cable is very short as you can see in the pictures. But since everyone will most likely charge them using their phone charges so it‚Äôs not a big deal.7. Microphone: Each of the earbuds have a microphone built in for calling but when I tried these over a call, I got a feedback from my friend that he was not hearing my voice very well when compared to my phone‚Äôs inbuilt microphone. So I don‚Äôt recommend these for attending voice calls.",Reviewed in India on 12 July 2023,Budget-friendly with Great Sound and Battery Backup!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6187p7fuGXL.jpg

R3ENKUSVAR2PL,RVS,"The boAt Airdopes 141 are wireless earbuds that offer a decent sound quality, long battery life, and low latency mode for gaming. They are also IPX4 water-resistant and have touch controls and voice assistant support. However, they also have some drawbacks, such as a bulky case, average noise cancellation, and lack of volume control on the earbuds. Here are some pros and cons of the boAt Airdopes 141:ProsSound quality: The earbuds have 8mm dynamic drivers that deliver clear and balanced sound with good bass. The boAt signature sound is immersive and enjoyable for most genres of music12Battery life: The earbuds have a playback time of up to 6 hours per charge and an additional 36 hours with the case. They also support ASAP fast charge technology that gives up to 75 minutes of playtime with just 5 minutes of charging. The case has a Type-C port for convenient charging12Low latency mode: The earbuds have a BEAST mode that reduces the audio lag while gaming or watching videos. The low latency mode can be activated by tapping the left earbud three times. This feature enhances the gaming experience and syncs the audio with the video12IPX4 water resistance: The earbuds are protected from water and sweat splashes with an IPX4 rating. This makes them suitable for outdoor activities and workouts. They can withstand light rain and sweat without any damage12Touch controls and voice assistant: The earbuds have quick response touch controls that allow you to play/pause music, answer/reject calls, activate voice assistant, and switch between modes. You can also access your default voice assistant (Siri or Google Assistant) with a single tap on the right earbud. The touch controls are responsive and easy to use12ConsBulky case: The case of the earbuds is quite large and heavy compared to other wireless earbuds in this price range. It may not fit easily in your pocket or bag. The case also has a glossy finish that attracts fingerprints and scratches easily34Average noise cancellation: The earbuds have ENx environmental noise cancellation technology that reduces the background noise during calls. However, the noise cancellation is not very effective and you may still hear some ambient sounds while listening to music or talking on the phone. The earbuds also do not have active noise cancellation (ANC) or transparency mode features that are available in some higher-end models34Lack of volume control: The earbuds do not have any option to adjust the volume level on the earbuds themselves. You have to use your phone or other connected device to change the volume. This can be inconvenient if you want to quickly lower or increase the volume without reaching for your phone34ConclusionThe boAt Airdopes 141 are wireless earbuds that offer good value for money with their sound quality, battery life, low latency mode, IPX4 water resistance, touch controls, and voice assistant support. They are ideal for casual listening, gaming, and workouts. However, they also have some drawbacks, such as a bulky case, average noise cancellation, and lack of volume control on the earbuds.

R2MVR88SCX8DHZ,Keekee,"This is the second pair of wireless earbuds that I've owned, but the first one that I bought.I've had them for 4 months at this point.‚úì The most important feature for me was the comfort of the buds. Most earbuds make my ears sore after any use longer than half an hour. I can wear these for hours at a time for days in a row if I want to.‚úì The noise canceling feature was also important for me. Even when they aren't in active noise canceling mode, I can't hear my partner (who has a deep and booming voice that's known to travel) when they're in the next room with the door open.‚úì The charging case can seem like it takes a while to fully charge, but I feel like it's worth it due to how long it stays charged and how many uses I can get from it.‚úì The sound quality is the best I've experienced from any headphone or earbud (not that I've tried a lot). The sound is clear, and I don't need to have my media up ridiculously high just to hear it anymore.‚úì The buds are magnetically pulled into their ports but aren't difficult to remove.‚úì It's perfect for traveling. The case is compact and the cord is short and comes in a little box to keep it organized.‚úó The case is sleek. I dropped it within seconds of picking it up out of the box because it slipped right out of my fingers.‚úó I was under the impression that I wouldn't need to install the app to use the different functions of the earbuds. It could be that I just haven't figured it out, but any time I try to delete the app, I have issues with getting the earbuds to work properly.‚úó Initially, I was impressed that these buds stayed in my ears as I went about my business, but it's gotten to a point where I do have to be mindful when they're in. If I smile too widely, they pop out. If I turn my head too fast or look up and to the side, they pop out. Sometimes they'll pop out when I bend to pick things up.",Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2024,"No regrets, will buy again if needed.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/512VdfVDbtL.jpg

R21QW6BL2KYQMW,Dewayne Chandler,"Full bass, superior noise cancelling/adaptive.  Very durable, they stay in my ears no matter what I'm doing.",Reviewed in the United States on 7 January 2024,Best earbuds ever,5.0 out of 5 stars,,0,,,samsung,,
R1YB8ELEYXY6U6,Parmesh Chopra,"IN BRIEF - if you can afford it, excellent balanced sound (no bass heavy stuff), best noise cancellation in all earphones, best fitting earphones in the world. Marvelous for gym also as they're sweat resistant. Mic only on right earbud seems a drawback. Bose music app is very basic. No equalizer offered too.Bought these before Diwali after a lot of research. Absolutely loved them. I use them while taking long walks or editing videos while attending a workshop simultaneously.THE MOST USEFUL FEATUREThe microphone embedded on the right earbud is unbelievably powerful. It cancels external noise during phone calls and focuses only on your voice. And all this while just being a tiny insertion in your ear. Remarkable. Almost hard to believe at first.COMFORT AND FITBose gives you three tip sizes to adjust on the eaebubds before you start using them. Finding  right tip is not optional. It is compulsory if you wish to experience active noise cancellation. Please note that once you get your ear tip size right, noise cancellation feature comes into play only then. And the noise cancellation is very very powerful. It is the best among the rest.ONCE IT FITS, IT WON'T COME OUT OF EARI jog, I run, I jump. My earbuds remain intact inside my ears. Grip is unbelievably firm. The lever fits so well in the ear. No chance of it popping out anytime. But please note you have to find your correct ear tip size before comfort and fit points stated by me become true for you.THE GOOD ABOUT THESEThe best feature in these as per my usage and observation is their ability to make your voice heard to the listener on a phone call in a noisy environment. So in my case I walk along traffic on a busy road in Gurgaon. But when I call using the earbuds, it is silky smooth. I hear the audio of the person at  the other end as swiftly as they hear mine. I double check with everyone when starting a call in traffic and they all have said they don't think I'm in traffic at all as my voice goes through super clear even after noise reduction. Excellent technology.Another great feature is double tap on earbuds to pick call without having the need to touch smartphone. And automatic playing of a YouTube video after a call in case you were watching before.Yet another remarkable feature, if not the most powerful one among all competitors - best noise cancellation for earbuds. Their noise cancellation and audio output gives a run for money to a full size over ear headphones. The overall experience is outstanding.THE NOT SO GOODBass lovers might be disappointed. The audio print of these earphones is neutral. They deliver naturally sounding crisp audio. No treble heavy or bass heavy.THE BADMicrophone is embedded only on right earbud. So if you wish to wear only left one, you can't take calls.You can't keep right earbud inside the case and insert only left earbud in your ear to listen to music. The right earbud has to be taken out of the case and kept outside if you only wish to use the left one.Prolonged usage might cause burning sensation in ear.",Reviewed in India on 12 December 2020,"The most comfortable, phone call making earbuds of 2020",5.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/916WsYFC9NL.jpg

RE3C941TXD7SB,Rohit matte,"I recently purchased a pair of earphones that turned out to be a complete disappointment. Not only did they fail to meet my expectations, but they were also a complete waste of my hard-earned money. Here's why I believe these earphones deserve such a poor review:Terrible Sound Quality: The most crucial aspect of any earphones is their sound quality, and these earphones failed miserably in that department. The audio was muffled, lacking clarity, and the bass was virtually nonexistent. I couldn't enjoy my music or podcasts with these earphones, as the sound was so poor it was borderline unbearable.Flimsy Build Quality: Right out of the box, I could tell these earphones were poorly constructed. The plastic used in their construction felt cheap and fragile. Within a few days of use, one of the earpieces started to crack, and eventually, it completely fell apart. It's clear that no attention was given to durability during the manufacturing process.Uncomfortable Fit: The design of these earphones is incredibly uncomfortable. They did not come with different-sized ear tips, so I was stuck with a one-size-fits-all solution that didn't fit my ears properly. I couldn't wear them for more than a few minutes without experiencing discomfort and pain.Terrible Noise Isolation: I expected these earphones to provide at least some level of noise isolation, but they failed to do so. I could hear external noises clearly, which completely defeated the purpose of using earphones. It was frustrating to have to raise the volume to drown out background sounds, further exacerbating the poor sound quality.Inadequate Customer Support: When I contacted customer support to express my concerns and request a refund or replacement, I was met with indifference. The representative seemed disinterested and unhelpful, providing no satisfactory resolution to my problem. It was an incredibly frustrating experience that left a sour taste in my mouth.Overall, I regret purchasing these earphones. They are a prime example of poor quality and lackluster performance. I would strongly advise against wasting your money on this product. Look elsewhere for earphones that offer better sound quality, durability, and customer support",Reviewed in India on 4 June 2023,Product is faulty,1.0 out of 5 stars,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oV2+3g-eL.jpg,2,Triple Black,,bose,,
R295V6GFLOTZQ2,Placeholder,"Being a Bose fan bought it.Has same quality that you expect from a Bose product.In terms of sound quality, which is the primary reason for buying a new earbud, it‚Äôs more or less same sound quality like Sound sports free. No plus stars there!Wireless charging is a plus.Sleeker look is a plus.Touch controls is a plus.A big blunder - You can‚Äôt control volume from the earbud, you have to do it through the connected source device. Why would Bose forget a volume control on the earbuds! It‚Äôs a touch control enabled earbud so some gestures in the earbuds could have been enabled to control volume as well - sadly that‚Äôs missing!More or less all the pluses are software driven.One major drawback in the earbuds is that unless you pump up the volume to beyond 80% the output of volume is abysmal.Most of bass and depth is only heard when you pump up the volume to 80% or above.Voice assistant on IPhone is only confined to Siri and doesn‚Äôt have options for Google or Alexa yet.Equalizer settings are missing too.Needs more software upgrades to incorporate these missing features.If sound quality is the only criteria then last Bose earbuds are as good and these can be skipped.Of course if you want the touch and wireless charging then go for these.Software seems to need several more upgrades to incorporate the missing features.",Reviewed in India on 17 October 2020,Software Driven Upgrade - Not Really Bang For Buck!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Dh0UxTyfL.jpg

R3E3MV327DY0VQ,Kavish Dani,"I used one plus buds previously and i was not happy with the product as it gave pain in my ears after some use.Well coming to nord 2 buds i was skeptical whether to buy or not. But let me tell you i am totally satisfied with the product this time.Case is very strong the hinge is of superb qualtiy if you shake it the upper part will not shake a little so good built qualtiy and good pairing response. One plus devices will have advantage of auto connect and it doesn't need pairing process to be followed where as for other device you have to download app helomelody for changing the function of buds.Coming to the buds. 5 star voice quality and bass is superb. The fit is so soft and it feels very light in ears. I tried riding bike at 100 while wearing it no issues it was in the place properly also tried shaking the head and running no issues. Buds can be controlled via app helomelody and one plus device have the software built in.Check the app screenshots. First is anc control. You will feel the difference when switching it from anc, off and transparent. You can listen how it will feel when you listen music or speak on call in transparent mode. You can feel the difference awesome feature. Anc will take more battery please note.Sound master let's you select equaliser and increse the bass wave.Game mode is for reducing latency while gaming.Earbud control. You can select 6 functions 3 each buds and that's an upgrade from one plus buds. There is single, double and triple tap. I have keptRight bud double tap next song/take calls, triple tap for previous trackLeft bud double tap voice assistant, 3 nonesingle tap for play for both right and left bud.Touch and hold for changing the anc mode or transparency mode.It also has tap feedback feature means when you tap he word it makes a click sound so that you can know how many times you have tapped the buds. So while you tap it thrice and hear two click sounds that means you have tapped twice and buds will respond to the function assigned to 2 taps.The best feature i found out is device switching. If your buds is paired with multiple devices then you can switch device by tap and hold for 3 secs it will connect to other device easily. I have tried in 2 phones haven't checked for more than 2 device or laptop.Overall it's  worth to buy this buds not to forget all these features on reasonable price. I loved it. It's far better than the one plus buds. Nice work one plus...If you are confused between buds nord and buds nord 2 there is a difference if bluetooth version and drivers that's it.Best and within budget...Edit: while driving the other person will hear lots of noise and speaking on call while driving a 2 wheeler is not at all possible, be aware of that I tried every modes but it just doesn't help.",Reviewed in India on 25 June 2023,Flawless ear buds.

R3KZ33F03CZR92,Raj Kriti Sinha,"Ordered during Great Indian Festival.Effective price after SBI Discount was Rs. 2250/-I ordered this product after thorough research.And I am happy that for this price, it exceeds my expectations.Design - Similar to Nord Buds the first. But, both the gray and white colors have some faint dotted design over the case and the stem of the buds. Faint flue dots over white. I was not prepared for that, at first glance, it looks a little dusty but can be overlooked.Both the case and buds are very lightweight and easy to carry.However, what I found to be a downside is that the buds dont have any magnetic attraction between them, so while they're easy to place in the case, outside the case they can't be clubbed together.Fit - Fits perfectly. No pain/discomfort. When I move my head from side to side, they stay put. I ran on the treadmill for a few minutes at 12kmph. They didn‚Äôt even budge. It didn‚Äôt feel like they would slip out. Which is great.Call Quality - The thing I was most worried about. And it passes the test. I live on a quiet street though - The other person is able to hear me loud and clear, and sometimes, ambient sound is also audible to them but the volume of that sound is much lower than my voice so it is not bothersome. Even in busier surroundings, no one has complained about my call quality yet!Audio Quality - I'm quite fond of listening to loud music. This does more than just justice to the loudness. I am more than happy listening at 50% volume. It‚Äôs definitely bass heavy. The quality of the sound is clear and crisp. I am very happy.ANC - It was not a priority for me, however, I did try it. Noise cancellation is definitely very effective. It does as much as promised, not more. However, there is a faint hissing sound. But it doesn‚Äôt bother me when playing some music or audio.Hey Melody - Its NOT detecting my earbuds yet lol. I'm an apple user. Let's see I'll try pairing it properly.Switching between devices - Unpair with one to pair with another. Not much of a hassle though, its fairly quick. And it automatically pairs with my phone as soon as I take it out of the case.Battery Life - Yet to be explored! I‚Äôm someone who carries all my chargers on the go and tend to keep all my devices well charged, so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to face much issue.My Personal Reasons why I didn't go for Buds Z2 even though my budget was flexible -1. In Ear Detection - if it goes haywire, I don't think there's an option to turn it off.2. Glossy finish - I was afraid it would slip out.3. It was released in 2021. About time we got a Z3, no?Reasons why I wanted Z2 -1. 3 mics2. Google pairing - easy switch between devices3.
