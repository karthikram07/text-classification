"R2MVR88SCX8DHZ","Keekee","This is the second pair of wireless earbuds that I've owned, but the first one that I bought.I've had them for 4 months at this point.‚úì The most important feature for me was the comfort of the buds. Most earbuds make my ears sore after any use longer than half an hour. I can wear these for hours at a time for days in a row if I want to.‚úì The noise canceling feature was also important for me. Even when they aren't in active noise canceling mode, I can't hear my partner (who has a deep and booming voice that's known to travel) when they're in the next room with the door open.‚úì The charging case can seem like it takes a while to fully charge, but I feel like it's worth it due to how long it stays charged and how many uses I can get from it.‚úì The sound quality is the best I've experienced from any headphone or earbud (not that I've tried a lot). The sound is clear, and I don't need to have my media up ridiculously high just to hear it anymore.‚úì The buds are magnetically pulled into their ports but aren't difficult to remove.‚úì It's perfect for traveling. The case is compact and the cord is short and comes in a little box to keep it organized.‚úó The case is sleek. I dropped it within seconds of picking it up out of the box because it slipped right out of my fingers.‚úó I was under the impression that I wouldn't need to install the app to use the different functions of the earbuds. It could be that I just haven't figured it out, but any time I try to delete the app, I have issues with getting the earbuds to work properly.‚úó Initially, I was impressed that these buds stayed in my ears as I went about my business, but it's gotten to a point where I do have to be mindful when they're in. If I smile too widely, they pop out. If I turn my head too fast or look up and to the side, they pop out. Sometimes they'll pop out when I bend to pick things up.","Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2024","No regrets, will buy again if needed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/512VdfVDbtL.jpg

"R3DWQHTPQ29YT3","Sam ","These buds are really great! After two days, I'm very satisfied. I previously had the live buds, still do. However when I used the live buds, when I'm at home, they work just fine but when I start walking outside or when I'm at the gym, the live buds weren't for me. Now that I have the Galaxy Buds 2, I'm definitely satisfied, the ear buds stay in sync with each other when i workout, they're comfortable, music sounds great and in perfect tune.

"R21BNLLQ5CEZW4","Amaze Custom","I bought these mainly to listen to music handsfree while doing home chores. The sound is very good, but it is a bit base-dominant for my taste.

I can‚Äôt hear all the different instruments clearly (like I used to with my old, cheaper buds). I figure I might get used to it.The noise cancelling is decent, although I could hear water from the tap I had left running in the bathroom while listening to music in the next room (luckily, though, because I‚Äôd forgotten about the tap running.

"R2I5Z8HUVWZ3OA","Kenton","I'm going to do a pros and cons list to make this alot simpler, and so you can easily find what you would like to know.Pros:1. Overall great sound quality, no complaints really, and there is a eq app that allows you to customize the sound to your preference. Whether that be if you like more bass or a soft listening experience.2. Comfort is good on these earbuds, genuinely some of the most comfortable earbuds out there. And they come with different sized ear pieces. But comfort is subjective so your mileage may vary.3. Battery life is great, I very rarely need to charge them. You can definitely get 6 hours out of them on a full charge. And the case can store an additional 15 hours. It takes 15 min to charge the earbuds to full and 2 hours to charge the case to full.Cons:1. Noise cancelation is not great. Don't be expecting to jump on a plane and drown out the engine, talking, and inevitable crying baby. The anc is like a 4/102. If you don't have a samsung phone it will not be as seamless of an experience. Meaning widgets won't display battery percentage, you also won't get a pop up when connected telling you battery percentage. You won't be able to change eq settings either since the app you need is only on samsung devices. So my advice is to get the respected earbuds that pair with your phone. So, if you have a iPhone, get airpods. If you have a pixel, get pixel buds. Etc.3. Minor nit-pick but sometimes my earbuds will randomly disconnect, so I will have to put them back in the case and then put them back in my ears.4. The touch controls aren't very good. They aren't very responsive, So don't bother with them.Overall they are extremely good earbuds for the price. They are a great budget option for wireless earbuds that will surely not disappoint. And if you have Samsung phone they are even better, with all the features you gain by staying in the samsung ecosystem.","Reviewed in the United States on 20 August 2023","Great wireless earbuds for the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","","108",

"RO46AEMG7IL2Q","Trey Brown","Purchased these when they were on sale and was completely blown away!First thing that stood out was the active noise cancellation! Being able to go from noise cancellation to ambient sounds is great, especially for certain situations!If you're in a loud environment and want to listen to music/audio books - noise cancellation! If you want to listen to music but need to be aware of your surroundings and hear people - ambient sounds!  The noise cancellation blocks out roughly 80-90% of the total outside sound; its amazing!  The ambient sounds option plays back your voice in the earbuds, so that you're not yelling at people next to you, you'll maintain your normal talking voice.As for the quality of sound - they're good! Nothing truly stands out here, but they have a good sound quality and there isn't too much bass/treble.Battery life is good! You'll get several hours of play time before needing to put them back in the case. Out of a full charge on the case, I can go about 2-3 days before needing to charge the case again.My advice to those that purchase - you get much more access to different options and controls if you download the Samsung Wearable app, which gives these earbuds even more appeal! Even if I didn't get these during a sale, they'd still 100% be worth the price!","Reviewed in the United States on 30 December 2023","Truly Impressive!","5.0 out of 5 stars","","2",

"R29PKM2YSC0ZK1","Cameron Wylie","Good sound quality, battery life, and noise isolation for a very affordable price. It's shocking to take the headphones off and realize how loud everything is going on around you, even in a relatively quiet spot. They fit really well and comfortable in my ears, which is unusual as my ear canals are somewhat narrow. They provide multiple plugs to find the right fit for you.You have to download the Samsung wearable app to have full control over them, which is a little annoying. It took a while to make a connection and I was wondering if I would have to return them. I think restarting my phone did the trick. Galaxy s22.The touch controls are a bit annoying and limited compared to other Samsung headphones I've owned. They do not have swipe gesture to control volume. I use these while working out, so I turn off touch controls altogether to prevent changing volume or stopping my music while I'm moving around.

"R2NP1MIL4JJ5UR","jinha","Great buds.Had so many issues with the Sennheiser CX True Wireless. Consant dropouts and having to factory reset every other week.Galaxy is so much better. Just plug and play.It might install some type of Galaxy Wearable app but you can just uninstall it. One trick is once you've paired the buds and stow they away. Turn on Phone Bluetooth then pull the buds out of the case, it'll reconnect on it's own and not have to bother with the Galaxy Wearable app screen. Or just double click back button on Android if you pair the regular way.Sound is incredible for $65, it won't knock your socks off but it surpasses it's price point. Also doesn't overwhelm you with bass like most earphones. Loud bass doesn't indicate good quality and I appreciate that Samsung agrees with that. Supposedly ANC only works when both buds are used but I've had luck on a single earbud. Pretty much can't hear noise on my left ear.Be careful using both buds on ANC when walking or crossing. It really does work well, maybe too well.Buds are comfortable even good enough for side sleepers on a firm pillow.Haven't tested the battery properly as I only use it for commute for about an hour. Usually only need to charge the case once every 10 days.  ANC will increase drain on the battery if activated.Overall really great buds for $65. Can't complain much and even the annoying app install can be removed or simply backed out by a couple presses of the back button. I've had more annoying earbuds before.

"R2PC8SZ52H62QJ","Jacob McDill","These little ear buds surprised me! The controls are intuitive and simple and the noise level and sound quality are fantastic for such a small device. The biggest surprise for me was the level of noise canceling you get. My only complaint would be the battery life in the ear buds. I don't think you'll be able to get a full day's use out of these without putting them back in the case for a bit to charge. That hasn't been a problem for me, but if that's what you're expecting, these might not be for you. That being said, the case has excellent battery life. I can use these all week using only the case to charge them.","Reviewed in the United States on 17 November 2023","Excellent sound quality","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0",
"RYL1FEY7GIB9C","Micah Kimball","I had a pair of knock-off Galaxy Buds, and the design was similar, but they had no ANC at all (even though the packaging hyped it up--it just didn't exist). The sound quality from them was barely acceptable--I didn't expect much from some cheap knock-offs.I have purchased renewed products before, and I know that sometimes it's a crap-shoot---you may get something that isn't any good.  I was willing to take that chance for some decent ear buds.When I got them, they still had a bit of charge, so I was eager to try them.  I opened up the case, and my phone (Samsung) immediately detected them and assigned them a name.  I put one in my ear and music from Spotify started playing. I got the other one in, and was immediately surprised at the depth and richness of the sound. The knock off pair didn't really have a lot of bass, but these Buds 2 really delivered (compared to the knockoffs).That's not to say that they have an amazing sound, but when you listen to Chinese fakes, the difference is staggering.Battery life is not as long as I would like--I get about 5 hours with ANC on, so it's not terrible, I just wish it was a bit longer---not that I have reason to have them in my ears for longer than that (well, except on plane rides).  The case doesn't take too long to top them off, but I haven't tested to see how many charges I can get out of the case.They are comfortable enough to sleep with them in my ears.  I have taken a few naps with them in my ears listening to some soft music and the ANC on, and have not been awakened by the neighbor's dogs--they are worth the price for that alone.I've very satisfied with this purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on 13 August 2023","Just like brand new","5.0 out of 5 stars","","23",

"R1LCQ19DN047II","Amazon Customer","For some context, I'm no audiophile. I do use a set of Phillips SHP9500 at my computer though. I'll update this as time passes and I use them more.2 month update: original review remains true, but I also need to add that the battery life is awesome! Even with ANC maxed and moderate volume I still get like 4 hours of music before they die.Pros:- Immediately comfortable. I tend to sleep in my earbuds and these are low enough profile to continue doing that.- Sound isolation works... alright. Moderate conversation in the same room will occasionally make it through, but it's definitely making a difference. The noise passthrough is actually more helpful to me, as I like to be aware of what's going on. It's easy to switch between the two as well, depending on my surroundings.- Really like the case. Very tactile.Cons:Man, the sound quality is underwhelming. I've got a handful of songs I test new audio stuff on and this made each one sound *really* muddy, with the exception of vocals which are actually really crisp. When I put my computer headphones back on, it was night and day different. I get that they had to pack a lot into a really small package, but music is the *one* thing I expect these to do well, especially at the price they're asking for it.Conclusion:Its fine.

Sound quality is good and the noise cancellation quality is pretty good too. In a room if someone calls me when I am listening to music, I can hardly tell. So, that I really liked it.However, I wish this pair of earphones had the multiple device connection available. I mean it is a really small thing. I have paired my earphones with both laptop and my phone. Then, when I connect it to my phone, when I try to connect to my laptop, it doesn't allow both connections like higher end headphones. So, when I am already connected to my 1st device, to get connected to my 2nd device, I have to manually connect to the 2nd device, then it would disconnect from the first device and switch to the 2nd. I found this a bit uncomfortable. Like for comparison, my sony Headphone can connect two devices at the same time without disconnecting the other, so I wish it had that feature.Other than that, I found the touch sensors a bit sensitive. When I try to adjust my earphones, it would always recognize the touch and would stop the music or the video I was watching. So that is a bit uncomfortable.

"R25F4IJR7B43QB","Lora Singleton","For years I used the cheap neckband style of Bluetooth earbuds, and when I decided a while back to switch to actual earbuds, I tried at least 3 or 4 brands and styles and couldn't find ones that didn't KILL my ears. IDK if my ears are weirdly-shaped or what, but I tried TOZO NC2s and JLab Go Air Pops which both were incredibly painful. I also tried a friend's Airpods briefly and they also hurt. Finally I spotted a relative's Galaxy Buds 2 and asked to try them and the difference was incredible - these are super comfortable!The sound quality is also incredible compared to all others I've tried, and while I've never really bothered with ANC on other ones I've tried, the noise cancelling on these is certainly good enough for me. I do tend to leave it off to save the battery though, which is the main weak point of these. 5 1/2 hours or so with noise cancelling on isn't great. But I find they block enough noise for me even with it off, which makes the battery life more like 8 hours or a bit over. Even with ANC off, they block enough that I can't hear someone across the room trying to get my attention unless they're really yelling. I often use just one earbud, and I like that you can use either on its own and easily switch between them.I have a Samsung phone, which means the Galaxy Wear app lets you manage these and use the equalizer settings and such. I also love the fast pair with Samsung, where they pop up immediately asking to pair or connect, and I REALLY like the seamless pairing feature that lets me switch them instantly between my phone and my (Windows) computer without have to go into Bluetooth settings and disconnect or unpair from one to pair to the other.Overall, very happy with these. I wasn't sure how much I would really use them, so was hesitant to pay the full retail price, and the first refurbished pair I tried had one earbud that didn't work which made me wary of going that route. So this international version seemed like a nice option. I added an Asurion protection plan just in case, but so far these have worked flawlessly for several months.","Reviewed in the United States on 3 November 2022","Love them","5.0 out of 5 stars","","16",

Sound stage is great and you won't miss a note. The battery life is quite well, for surpassing what I was thinking and the quick recharging in the case makes it so you won't miss the music for to long while waiting for the buds to recharge.

"R8ZQW2Z4EPQ3X","A","These are the best earbuds I've used so far. I used a set of akg n400's before, but they were way too uncomfortable, fell out too easily, and battery life sucked. That could just be me and the fact I didn't have the other silicone ear triangle things. Not sure these sound as good as the n400's, but they sound very good.Sound:I like good audio, but I really don't have a great ear for judging quality. That said, these sound great to me. They sound very similiar to the AKG N400's perhaps with less bass.Fit:The buds2 fit in my ear very nicely with the included tips and I can wear them for around 9hrs without issues. They do fall out occasionall, but it's usually easy to feel when they're falling out and adjust them.Battery:The battery life on these is very impressive, as they often last 6-9hrs without charging in the case. For some reason the earbuds often drain their batteries unevenly, so you'll end up with one dead and one with 20-30% charge still. The case battery is very good and I've never ran it empty before.Case:Honestly, the case is probably my biggest issue with these earbuds. Any light drop and the case will shoot out the tiny earbuds in a 360, and then the case will close itself. This makes it really easy to lose the earbuds and not notice because the case closed itself back up.Buttons: It took me a few weeks of using the earbuds to appreciate the touch controls. Now it works fairly reliably. The app also gives you a lot of controls for the buttons.Noise Cancellation/Ambient Sound: Noise cancelling is pretty good. Not amazing but good. Some static is audible when using it. Ambient sound is okayish. It picks up on a lot of unwanted background noises like fan noise and doesn't pick up on people's speech well. Both of these features are made worse by what I talk about below.Other issues. Perhaps the most annoying issue is the earbuds have some sensor that detects if the earbud is in your ear. If it detects one earbud is not in your ear, it will disable noise cancelling or ambient sound until it detects them in your ear again. It's a great idea but it malfunctions all the time if the earbuds aren't perfectly seated in your ear. Meaning you'll be adjusting them a lot if you use noise cancelling or ambient sound. The app seriously some spyware. I've never seen any app ask for more permissions and it won't open if you deny most of them. I recommend you have some way to trick the app to deny permissions if you care about privacy. The main permissions you want to deny is location or it's ability to connect to the internet if your phone can do that, unless you need its find my earbuds ability. Otherwise the app is pretty useful and leagues better than the AKG app.","Reviewed in the United States on 1 January 2024","Best Earbuds I've used, with some downsides","5.0 out of 5 stars","","4",

"R11G7P0P9ECVA3","Alex Gonzalez","The Galaxy Buds 2 are good quality Bluetooth earbuds. Having owned the Galaxy Buds+ originally, these were a decent upgrade in some regards and a downgrade in others.**Comfort**Probably the most important aspect of earbuds for some people is the comfort quality. The earbuds include 3 different size ear tips to help you find the right fit. Additionally, in the Galaxy Wearable app, there is a feature to actually test the fit. This is helpful as you can tinker and find the right earbud tip combinations for you. Prolonged sessions did result in some ear fatigue for me and I found the tips becoming a bit loose with excessive movement. I would probably not wear these to work out in. My aforementioned Galaxy Buds+ have wingtips on the top that help them remain securely in place, I find them to be a bit more comfortable than these.**Battery Life**Battery life on the Galaxy Buds 2 appear to be as advertised. For my use they are perfect as I do not wear my buds for long periods of time and am able to charge them in between sessions easily. The included charging case is easy to use and I can snap the buds in with no issues. Again, the Galaxy Buds+ were a bit better in this regard with the battery lasting around 9 hours on one charge, but they also did not have Active Noise Cancellation which consumes a good amount of battery life.**Connectivity**Using a Galaxy phone makes connecting these headphones a breeze! It was a simple as opening the case. Seriously, once I did that my phone recognized it and had a popup to pair. Connecting them to my tablet (S8) was not as easy. I had to put the earbuds into pairing mode and open my Galaxy Wearable app on the  tablet and connect that way. Once set up, it is very easy to reconnect. I also was able to pair with my Chromecast for late night TV viewing without waking up my wife.**Audio**This is where this set of earbuds earns its keep in my opinion. I am by NO MEANS an audiophile but the audio quality coming from the Buds+ was night and day for me. Music, TV, and calls all sound clear and crisp with a decent amount of bass without virtually 0 static. The ambient noise and active noise cancellation features work as intended and the 360 audio is a very cool feature to add a level of immersion, especially when watching movies.**Conclusion**This is a solid set of earbuds and at the current price point, makes a ton of sense in my opinion. I am very pleased with this set and will continue to use them as my ""daily driver"" earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States on 17 April 2023","Samsung strikes again!

I wouldn't have noticed if my cheap $18 pair didn't connect seamlessly by delaying the audio until they were ready so that you don't miss any words. Speaking of connection, they disconnect frequently. They usually reconnect themselves immediately, but it's strange that they disconnect themselves this often (again, this causes your audio to blackout randomly). As far as the fit goes, they aren't painful but they wiggle free VERY easily and I wouldn't want to work out in them. When I smile, they pretty much fall out of my ears. Also, the spherical design makes it incredibly difficult to adjust/remove/put in without pausing, skipping, or engaging the noise cancellation. The noise cancellation is actually really great, which makes all of the other issues aggravating. This review is written by someone who has bought about a half-dozen Bluetooth earbuds over the last 6 years. Almost all of them have been cheap- sub $30. The pair I'm wearing right now was $18. I figured that a nicer pair would be worth the price and IT IS NOT. I honestly feel like I got hosed and like this product is not accurately listed on this site.","Reviewed in the United States on 11 September 2023","Definitely not worth it","1.0 out of 5 stars","","7",

"R11DO9OZQI80F4","Chris & Tracy","I got these to replace my Galaxy Buds+, which I lost.  Compared to the Buds+, the sound quality is pretty much identical.  The noise cancellation is kind of a gimmick IMHO.  If you are listening to music at normal/loud levels, then the cancellation is kind of superfluous.  At low volumes, when listening to podcasts or something, then it does an okay job of lowering certain frequencies, but the tradeoffs are that it seems to add a scooped EQ to the sound and it gives me a strange feeling like I need to pop my ears or something.  Frankly, it's uncomfortable.These things are a lot harder to hold onto than the Buds+ as well.  The Buds+ had sharper edges that you could grip to hold when putting them in and taking them out of your ears.  The Buds2 are completely slick, and so is the case, so expect to drop these things constantly.And the case is the worst part.  Mine stopped charging my buds within a few weeks...perhaps related to it being dropped because it's too damn slick to hold onto.I lowkey hate these things and want my Buds+ back.

"R1I56S6GJA3MZQ","Carlos E. Castro","I bought these earbuds after reading a zillion reviews and specs comparisons. They all said, including Samsung's, that the battery lasts about 7 hours and slightly less with ANC. However, the first time I used them, the battery lasted 3 and 1/2 hours. I ran a test in which I played music through them at 50% volume and the battery died at 4 hours and 30 min WITHOUT ANC. That's only 68% of the stated battery life. I think that these earbuds were stored for so long that the battery just came sort-of-DoA.Pros:Size is perfect for people with small ears like me.They ARE comfy. VERY comfy for 3 hours at least.The sound, omg, THE SOUND.

I was thinking of just getting a cheaper one than the Galaxy Buds Pro I've had since I was just going to use this 2nd pair mostly for the sound feature and not the microphone.I thought these ear Buds were going to be not as bad as the Galaxy Buds Pro, but when I opened the package, the first thing I noticed was how cheap and light the material of the case was. It feels like very cheap plastic. The ear buds also feel cheap, at least compared to my Buds Pro. The sound isn't bad at all, but the microphone is not good. It sounds very low and not clear.

These are great at noise canceling and have a really good boost for music. Can't lie, I have worn them to the gym and constantly had to fix them to keep them from falling out of my ears. I have even changed the size of the rubber around the earpiece and they still fall out. I will say they are durable though. Dropped them in the parking lot and I think one was scathed by a tire and still worked well. They fall out of the case a lot if you have them in a case that has a keychain on it.

Buscando en foros en internet no hay forma de bajarle el volumen a esos sonidos o eliminarlos por completoPor otro lado, despu√©s de conectarlos una vez, tienes que conectarlos cada vez que los saques del estuche, no es mucho problema pero si es incomodo, es decir, el proceso es as√≠: te pones los audifonos y luego abres la app de ""wearables"" de samsung y luego le das en conectar... parece sencillo pero cuando est√°s acostumbrado a simplemente ponerte los audifonos y se conectan autom√°ticamente pues si molesta un poco.En general el sonido es bueno, la cancelaci√≥n de ruido activa deja que desear, y la opci√≥n de de sonido ambiental se siente mal, es como si un ventilador estuviera soplando aire en tus o√≠dos todo el tiempo.Son comodos, pero no los recomiendo para hacer ejercicio, como correr, porque est√°n construidos de un material muy liso y al hacer movimientos bruscos se mueven con facilidad, luego hacen un beep cada vez que se mueven de tus o√≠dos.Para finalizar quiero decir que los Huawei freebuds 4i son muy superiores a estos audifonos, aunque tienen menos opciones en su app, pero la ejecuci√≥n de las funciones son mejores, la cancelaci√≥n de ruido es mejor en los 4i porque f√°cilmente se nota que pasan menos ruidos, el sonido de ambiente tambi√©n es mucho mejor porque en estos se escucha natural casi como si no trajeras aud√≠fonos y por ultimo y mas importante, no tiene sonidos al cambiar de funciones! lo cual evita que te desconcentres de lo que est√©s escuchando o que tengas miedo de cambiar porque te va a lastimar el ""beep"" infernal.","Reviewed in Mexico on 12 October 2022","No los hubiera comprado si hubiera sabido esto...","3.0 out of 5 stars","","6",

The flip side is, that you can easily use your shoulder to pause and unpause if your hands are occupied.

"RB4PZBWC7FLEF","Troi","I've had previous Galaxy and even Jaba buds but found this to best so far. The bass is good, you can use just one and it doesn't matter which, the controls are customizable and easy to use, and the fit is decent. The con to this is that when you put noise cancellation OFF it is still extremely hard to hear anything around you. I've had music playing at a moderate and low level in my office with noise cancellation off and still couldn't hear when someone was talking to me. With the noise cancellation ON while riding the subway, it does an amazing job of blocking out the background noise of the car and rail but I've noticed it still picks up on voices near you. Of course, if you are playing music you won't hear the voices. The fit is a little iffy at least I've noticed the bean shape working it's way out of my ears if chewing gum or eating and constantly have to readjust. If just walking, I don't have to adjust it nearly as often.","Reviewed in the United States on 9 December 2022","Good but still has room to improve","4.0 out of 5 stars","","4",

"R1WOD2I58YP8MU","Rush","I didn't want to write this review until I had a lot of time with these earphones. After weeks of rigerous use and while working (delivering for Amazon), I have a solid opinion on this product.I wanted to be able to listen to music and talk on the phone while on the go or at work but isn't really possible with wired earphones. These Galaxy Buds 2 are a great option but definitely not perfect.The sound quality of the buds 2 are great but if you don't keep them clean, the sound quality goes down. The battery life of the buds and case are quite impressive. I use only 1 bud at a time which each lasts me about 4 hours while the case can last about 16 hours on a full charge. The ambient and noise canceling features are great too but the ambient sound feature can get too noisy if it's windy or a lot of stuff going on in the background. The phone quality is good but sometimes the person I'm on call with has trouble hearing me if I'm moving around or there's too much background sound (which is usually the case while I'm delivering) but still works okay so don't expect the best quality with phone calls. I also love the wireless charging feature.Overall this has been one of my best purchases of the year as I definitely have gotten my money's worth and enjoyment out of this product.

"R13SF1U0HCTX3U","William K. Volkman","International version so no warranty.  Still overpriced.  Have some $20 JLab pieces of junk that have better audio than this.  These are very ""tinny"" sounding. The ear buds leap out of the ear after about an hour, has happened on both sides of my head.  First time it happened I caught it and it cut off the sound of the meeting.  Had to turn off blue tooth and reconnect with charger.  Getting it to pair with an additional device was almost impossible, took 8 tries and turning off bluetooth on everything else in range. The user manuals were useless.  No obvious way to change volume or lower treble. Samsung app is intrusive, refuses to run if you don't give it location permission, wanted access to my contacts and media/camera files.  Cute box though.  Certain one of the buds will fall out in the next week and I'll end up throwing in trash.  Don't bother.Update: 03/20/2023 - These things keep falling out.  I'm not exercising, I'm sitting quietly at my computer on conference calls.  The sound is bad, my coworkers report that I sound like I'm in the car, very faint and like in a tunnel.  You need the Galaxy Wearables app which requires all of the permissions or will not run to be able to adjust the volume.  Someone gifted me some AirPods Gen 2, not a fan of apple products however they don't fall out, they have good sound, still very poor microphone as reported by my coworkers, a hassle to use with Android phone and their special charging requirements (only charges when connected to my mac).","Reviewed in the United States on 11 March 2023","Find something else - falls out of the ear after about an hour","1.0 out of 5 stars","","7",

My ears need the large ones. This is really unbelievable that Samsung would have designed something like this, that is so flawed.In addition, you need to use an app to see the charge status of your earbuds.

Why they designed them like this, I don't know.They take forever to connect to my Galaxy S21+, and even after they claim to be connected, they still don't receive or transmit sound. On picking up a call, the phone has a seizure and flits between the regular call style, speaker phone, and ear buds.They don't register when 1 or both are in my ear. With the Buds Plus, I could use just 1 bud and it would convert the audio to mono.

Worse, every time I touch them to try to push them back in my ear, they interpret it as a ""tap"" and either the sound quality changes radically -- I start hearing myself in the earbuds while I'm speaking -- or the call gets disconnected.Thanks so much, Samsung, for replacing a $10 jacked-in earbud that worked perfectly well with an $100 bluetooth earbud that wont stay in my ear.

The first thing to know is that if you read the description carefully; these are the INTERNATIONAL Version, not the US Version. The only difference is the warranty. These have a 30 day warranty while the US version has a full year. I paid $65 for mine, while the US Version retails for $150.The earbuds themselves are great, super simple pairing with my Samsung Galaxy S23+.The fit is very comfortable, I can see forgetting your wearing them. Noise canceling works very well. The sound quality is VERY good also. I initiated mine with TOOL: DESCENDING, and it sounded much better than my old Skull Candy earbuds. Better, more realistic bass and cleaner highs.These are well worth the sub $70 price tag. If the one year warranty is that important to you, maybe splurge for the $150 version.

One advantage that the Galaxy buds 2 have, however, is the ability to simply turn noise canceling off without turning aware mode on.If you are looking for the best sound quality or best noise canceling, these are not it as they are pretty middle of the road. I would recommend buying these if you care more about discreet and stylish look, comfort, compatibility with Samsung devices, and nice small size of the case.
