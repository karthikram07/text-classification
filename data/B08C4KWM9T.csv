"R1YB8ELEYXY6U6","Parmesh Chopra","IN BRIEF - if you can afford it, excellent balanced sound (no bass heavy stuff), best noise cancellation in all earphones, best fitting earphones in the world. Marvelous for gym also as they're sweat resistant. Mic only on right earbud seems a drawback. Bose music app is very basic. No equalizer offered too.Bought these before Diwali after a lot of research. Absolutely loved them. I use them while taking long walks or editing videos while attending a workshop simultaneously.THE MOST USEFUL FEATUREThe microphone embedded on the right earbud is unbelievably powerful. It cancels external noise during phone calls and focuses only on your voice. And all this while just being a tiny insertion in your ear. Remarkable. Almost hard to believe at first.COMFORT AND FITBose gives you three tip sizes to adjust on the eaebubds before you start using them. Finding  right tip is not optional. It is compulsory if you wish to experience active noise cancellation. Please note that once you get your ear tip size right, noise cancellation feature comes into play only then. And the noise cancellation is very very powerful. It is the best among the rest.ONCE IT FITS, IT WON'T COME OUT OF EARI jog, I run, I jump. My earbuds remain intact inside my ears. Grip is unbelievably firm. The lever fits so well in the ear. No chance of it popping out anytime. But please note you have to find your correct ear tip size before comfort and fit points stated by me become true for you.THE GOOD ABOUT THESEThe best feature in these as per my usage and observation is their ability to make your voice heard to the listener on a phone call in a noisy environment. So in my case I walk along traffic on a busy road in Gurgaon. But when I call using the earbuds, it is silky smooth. I hear the audio of the person at  the other end as swiftly as they hear mine. I double check with everyone when starting a call in traffic and they all have said they don't think I'm in traffic at all as my voice goes through super clear even after noise reduction. Excellent technology.Another great feature is double tap on earbuds to pick call without having the need to touch smartphone. And automatic playing of a YouTube video after a call in case you were watching before.Yet another remarkable feature, if not the most powerful one among all competitors - best noise cancellation for earbuds. Their noise cancellation and audio output gives a run for money to a full size over ear headphones. The overall experience is outstanding.THE NOT SO GOODBass lovers might be disappointed. The audio print of these earphones is neutral. They deliver naturally sounding crisp audio. No treble heavy or bass heavy.THE BADMicrophone is embedded only on right earbud. So if you wish to wear only left one, you can't take calls.You can't keep right earbud inside the case and insert only left earbud in your ear to listen to music. The right earbud has to be taken out of the case and kept outside if you only wish to use the left one.Prolonged usage might cause burning sensation in ear.","Reviewed in India on 12 December 2020","The most comfortable, phone call making earbuds of 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/916WsYFC9NL.jpg

"RE3C941TXD7SB","Rohit matte","I recently purchased a pair of earphones that turned out to be a complete disappointment. Not only did they fail to meet my expectations, but they were also a complete waste of my hard-earned money. Here's why I believe these earphones deserve such a poor review:Terrible Sound Quality: The most crucial aspect of any earphones is their sound quality, and these earphones failed miserably in that department. The audio was muffled, lacking clarity, and the bass was virtually nonexistent. I couldn't enjoy my music or podcasts with these earphones, as the sound was so poor it was borderline unbearable.Flimsy Build Quality: Right out of the box, I could tell these earphones were poorly constructed. The plastic used in their construction felt cheap and fragile. Within a few days of use, one of the earpieces started to crack, and eventually, it completely fell apart. It's clear that no attention was given to durability during the manufacturing process.Uncomfortable Fit: The design of these earphones is incredibly uncomfortable. They did not come with different-sized ear tips, so I was stuck with a one-size-fits-all solution that didn't fit my ears properly. I couldn't wear them for more than a few minutes without experiencing discomfort and pain.Terrible Noise Isolation: I expected these earphones to provide at least some level of noise isolation, but they failed to do so. I could hear external noises clearly, which completely defeated the purpose of using earphones. It was frustrating to have to raise the volume to drown out background sounds, further exacerbating the poor sound quality.Inadequate Customer Support: When I contacted customer support to express my concerns and request a refund or replacement, I was met with indifference. The representative seemed disinterested and unhelpful, providing no satisfactory resolution to my problem. It was an incredibly frustrating experience that left a sour taste in my mouth.Overall, I regret purchasing these earphones. They are a prime example of poor quality and lackluster performance. I would strongly advise against wasting your money on this product. Look elsewhere for earphones that offer better sound quality, durability, and customer support","Reviewed in India on 4 June 2023","Product is faulty","1.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oV2+3g-eL.jpg","2","Triple Black"
"R295V6GFLOTZQ2","Placeholder","Being a Bose fan bought it.Has same quality that you expect from a Bose product.In terms of sound quality, which is the primary reason for buying a new earbud, it’s more or less same sound quality like Sound sports free. No plus stars there!Wireless charging is a plus.Sleeker look is a plus.Touch controls is a plus.A big blunder - You can’t control volume from the earbud, you have to do it through the connected source device. Why would Bose forget a volume control on the earbuds! It’s a touch control enabled earbud so some gestures in the earbuds could have been enabled to control volume as well - sadly that’s missing!More or less all the pluses are software driven.One major drawback in the earbuds is that unless you pump up the volume to beyond 80% the output of volume is abysmal.Most of bass and depth is only heard when you pump up the volume to 80% or above.Voice assistant on IPhone is only confined to Siri and doesn’t have options for Google or Alexa yet.Equalizer settings are missing too.Needs more software upgrades to incorporate these missing features.If sound quality is the only criteria then last Bose earbuds are as good and these can be skipped.Of course if you want the touch and wireless charging then go for these.Software seems to need several more upgrades to incorporate the missing features.","Reviewed in India on 17 October 2020","Software Driven Upgrade - Not Really Bang For Buck!","3.0 out of 5 stars","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Dh0UxTyfL.jpg

"R3HC5B08WM74B1","Pallav Gupta","I am using this masterpiece since last 11 days now.1. Got this delivered to me the very next day of my order.2. Bluetooth 5.1 is really quick. Gets connected to the device without any lag. One time- One device, but that's really ok. can switch from 1 device to another easily using Bose Music app.3. Touch controls are super sharp. No lag and No false command.4. Company says battery lasts for 6hrs on ANC and the case gives 12hrs of extra charge so total 18hrs. But this is a false comment from company. The earbuds last 8+hrs on a single charge and case gives 15+ hrs of extra charge. Its been 11 days since i bought, i charged on the 1st day of arrival, and today after 11 days, there were 2 points left in the case that means another 40% still left. I don't think any other earbuds may last longer than this.5.  Noise cancellation is as expected.6. Just found 1 issue with the wireless charging. I dont think Magsafe charger(Apple) works on it. As soon as i placed the case on the magsafe, it started charging, but even after 2hrs, no progress.while on normal type c charger, it gets charged within 2hrs.7. Size dosen't really matter to me, so the big case(Twice as compared to apple airpods pro) isn't a issue for me. even the out of the earbuds isn't an issue for me as compared to airpods.8. Bose music app takes care of the software upgrades on background. So no need to manually check.9. I not a music enthusiast, I bought this for my business meetings and calls, sometimes movies. It perform great on that.10. Tried some high bass and beats music to test the performance. Thrilled for an earbuds to perfrom like these.11. Don't compare any earbuds with headphones. Obviously they will be better in noise cancellation, sound quality but compare among the earbuds product only.12. I have Airpods pro too, Bose easily defeated Airpods pro in every aspect- i told size doesn't matter to me13. I watched some 100 videos on youtube before buying this product. So got a clear picture of what i was going to buy. Every video has compared bose with Airpods pro.14. Obviously overpriced, but what if they lasts longer than airpods pro?

After a month or so, they sent me a replacement unit. But now this too has stopped working altogether. I am not able to pair the buds with any of the apple products I have. The blue tooth function is not getting activated.  The product now is useless. If you plant to use the buds for a year , this is OK. But then you will have to pay high price for this.

"R2EOOOBCTKTDLH","Placeholder","Update after 2 yrs:After getting the first faulty device replaced since it was under warranty, the second device again stopped working after 2 yrs. There was no physical damage. The earbuds simply get disconnected from bluetooth when i pick them out from the case. This time when I visited the service center, they said they can't do any repairs beyond software upgrade. The only thing Bose service center offered was 10% off if I upgrade to quietcomfort 2 :)Needless to say, I am never buying Bose againAfter 1 month of purchase:i had a horrible experience which seems to be quite commonplace with Bose these days. I am saying this because 3 of my other friends also had a similar experience in past 6 months with bose earbuds. For me, the left earbud suddenly stopped working just 8 days after the purchase and then began my tiresome journey to get adequate support. Mind you, there was no physical damage; it just stopped working after i took it out from the case on the 8th day.  I tried all the troubleshooting steps started on bose website but nothing worked. Called Amazon but they refused to provide any help on this as their replacement policy is valid for only 7 days. I also contacted the bose flagship store in Bangalore but they stated that they can replace it immediately only if the product was purchased from a physical store. The store representative even chided me for purchasing it on amazon and said that such problems are bound to occur if purchased online. This took me by complete surprise as i never expected a big brand like Bose to have such different standards in product and support quality for offline and online channels.Lastly, after nth attempt to conact Bose' customer support, i was given the address of a 3p service center. Upon visiting that service center, it took over an hour for them to try some software updates etc and then finally they declared that the piece is faulty and would need to be replaced. However, this only service center in Bangalore didn't even have a single replacement unit of this device which is one of fastest selling sku of Bose. Now i have been told that i need to wait for 10 days for the stock to arrive and then they will replace it. Moreover, neither the Bose customer care helpline nor the phone number of the 3p service center is picking up my calls to inform me the status of ordered replacement stock. There is absolutely no tracking provided. I guess they expect me to keep visiting the service center once every 2-3 days to check for the status.","Reviewed in India on 14 October 2021","Horrible experience....Left earbud stopped working in a week","1.0 out of 5 stars","","16","Soapstone"

"R20CZMPRURLXIV","Sanjay Kumar Sena","Awesome sound quality and ANC. The sound quality depends upon the device you are connecting and the app you are using. Earlier I was using jiosaavn but the sound quality was not so impressive. Then I tried spotify and there was big difference. Spotify combined with Moto audio gave an amazing sound quality. Bass, treble everything is balanced. This might disappoint heavy bass lovers. To check the sound quality you can play the tracks - Surface by Aero Chord, Animals, silent shout, drover, tsunami etc. It supports AAC and SBC codec and not aptX.As far as touch controls are concerned, you can skip to next track by touching and holding the left earbud. This shortcut needs to be enabled from the bose music app. Double tap the left earbud to switch to 3 different ANC levels, also these 3 levels can be set through the app. Swipe up the right earbud to increase the volume or swipe down to decrease the volume, again this control needs to be turned on through the bose music app. Double tap the right earbud to pause/play tracks or receive/disconnect calls. Touch and hold the right earbud to decline a call or activate your phone's voice assistant.In terms of connectivity, it pairs very fast and range is also good.For the users like me battery backup is also good. I use it almost 2-3 hours every day and in last 11 days I have charged it for just once.Looks and build quality of other competitors might be quite good but for me the sole purpose of a earphone is to deliver High quality sound and this requirement is faithfully served by these buds.","Reviewed in India on 4 June 2021","Rediscover Music","5.0 out of 5 stars","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B17YTwoSJRS.jpg

"R1T6WYKI1PLIIF","Ashwin","It's obviously the beast. The sound is thunderous, there's no doubt about it. The beats are very very clear and the bass is appropriate, neither too much nor too less, just the right amount. Noise cancellation is also superb. Obviously you can't compare it with any headphones specifically bose nc 700 or Sony WH-1000XM4,but in comparison of any earphone available in the market by far, its the best. Sound quality is also very fine. Each and every tune, beats etc are clear. Battery life is also good. Bose say 6 hrs and more or else it is true. Many things depends upon your usage, sound level, nc on or off, using for listening music or calling etc etc. Battery life will depend on that. Just I have a little problem or say it more as a disappointment that it is not as comfortable as bose soundsport truly wireless, though it is far more comfortable with bose sports earbuds, which I personally am not able to use it for more than 2 hrs atmost after that the ear starts hurting a lot. It is far far better than that, but since I have a soundsport truly wireless and I am using it since last 2.5 years so I know it is the best if you will compare the comfort level.Overall very happy with the product.

This product does allow right ear single bud use but not for left ear .I was surprised as how such awesome product does not have this basic feature which is even available in earbuds costing less then 1000 rupees .I have requested for return and may opt for next higher version of this product which does hav this feature now .Thanks","Reviewed in India on 27 October 2023","Single bud use","1.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Triple Black"

"RILXI9K5WHHHM","TarunThawani","Had to exchange because right earbud was not working. Amazon was prompt in setting up a one on one exchange ie the delivery guy for new earbuds took away the old ones too. Now they're working. They're a little bit uncomfortable in the ear. And I observed a little lag. And the mic is not very sensitive so I must speak loud. Plus sometimes on a call it tries to cancel out not just my noise but also on the other person's end which is irritating because white noise keeps appearing when the cancellation fails, eg when the person speaks. I researched a lot so this is definitely the best earbud tech out there.","Reviewed in India on 1 June 2021","Had to exchange because right earbud was not working","4.0 out of 5 stars","","4","Soapstone"

"R3HQ9NJFWVJR1S","Dinesh Shenoi P","The Bose Earbuds purchased first in Oct 2021 developed issues on the left ear bud after use of just 8 months. When I raised a compliant with Bose via Amazon, they replaced it with a new one in Aug 2022 as this was within the warranty period of 1 year. However the replacement new one that I received developed a similar issue with the left ear bud and not able to use it. After going through the reviews of Bose in other sites, I understand that this seems to be a common problem with Bose earbuds. But for the expensive buds that we purchase it for, Bose should by default give at least a 2 year warrants to justify the high cost that it charges. Now I am hesitant to purchase Bose buds again for fear of this issue.","Reviewed in India on 18 February 2023","Bose left ear bud not working","2.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Triple Black"

"R3DZJTMZ2R151R","Saurabh Vashist","Received the earbuds today and I have been using them for a day and so far so good (actually excellent!). Let me start with the Good.1) Extremely good Active Noise Cancellation: You can precisely control the level of noise cancellation with the Bose App.2) Perfect fit for the ears (if you try all combinations!): Bose has suggested to try out all sorts of permutations and combinations on the various sizes provided (1-3). To my surprise, in my right ear, size 1 fit perfectly - while in my left ear, size 2 earbud was a better fit.3) No displacement: Once this was sorted, I went for a run and did a intense HIIT workout, did a couple of work calls and all this without once feeling that they might fall off.4) Battery life: While Bose claims a battery life of 6 hours, I have been using them for the last 8 hours straight.Cons:1) Some might find it bulky and heavy. Depends on whether you prefer better ANC vs better design (AirPods Pro are for you then).2) Can only connect with one device at a time. Serious drawback, I hope they fix this via an update.","Reviewed in India on 15 October 2020","Excellent ANC, some might it bulky, fits perfectly for me","5.0 out of 5 stars","","49","Triple Black"

"R3E2CHHG2D81SX","CSR","The sound quality is amazing. One of the best. But, dependability is a big issue. I bought one online and had to return it because of connectivity issues. A year later I purchased it from Croma where it was on an offer. I ignored the bulkiness, and the rather cheap build quality of the case and decided to put my money on the sound quality. Sadly, within 14 hours of purchase, one of the earbuds just stopped working. I had a very difficult time getting a refund on the product from Croma. Long story short, here's what you need to consider:1- If you are looking at ease of connectivity and reliability, and if you are on iOS, go for the Airpods Pro2- If it's an android that you are having, check out the Galaxy buds pro. They are simply awesome at the price point.3- But if you're willing to take a chance, then go for this4- If you don't want any of the well-known leading brands, you may want to consider the Momentum 3 TWSHope this helps.","Reviewed in India on 6 June 2022","Very unreliable performance","2.0 out of 5 stars","","7","Triple Black"

Glitchy set up and clunky app required turning off all other Bluetooths nearby. Post set up, ANC, soundstage and clarity was amazing. Left earprice simply stopped working in 2 days. Tried a bunch of fixes from Bose website and the internet. Nothing worked and it seemed that the left earpiece battery is dead. Ordered a replacement which arrived promptly. Setup this time was easier since going to a middle of a park avoided all other Bluetooth signals. Again was blown away by the sound and ANC quality. Right earpiece decided to quit audio in 3 days, and the left one tagged along with it. Not the earprice battery this time but seems to be glitchly signal from right to left earpiece stopping all audio from both earpieces if used together. Left earpiece works fine if used alone after reformatting all connections, but the moment you take the right earpiece out of the box, it's game over. No way do a factory reset to get rid of glitchy updates if that's the issue or to take another walk to the park to re-ignite our pairing. Heartbroken with Bose's inablility to launch a reliable pair of earbuds which doesn't ghost you if you look at them side ways. Requested a return now and have purchased a competitor product.

But after wearing these, they completely go away. So it gives me a lot of much needed peace when I am at home. Just ensure that the eartip fit is tight yet comfortable. Even other sounds are greatly muffled. I can wear it for hours without any discomfort.

"R3HATFE02T9G0R","Siddharth Tata","Edited review- written Nov-2023Was using this product with good experience for past 13 months. One fine day the left earbud stopped working (red and white light flashing). Called service Center to find out that this product cannot be repaired and was offered a 10 percent discount if I buy a new one as warranty is for 12 months only. Just outraged at the fact that a product from a brand like Bose can stop working a month after warranty and there is no remedy. Willing to pay service pays to fix it- but they say they can’t do anything about it. Internet has a lot of similar reviews of product just failing suddenly. Don’t buy this until you are confident that Bose has fixed the defect or are willing to live with a piece of junk immediately after 1 year.Original review- written Sep-2022First the positives- the Bose noise cancelling is the boss of the industry. I have about 10 Bose products at home and the one thing that always delights is the sound quality. The not so great parts- the buds are large and come in a large case- Bose needs to fix this on their next generation.Now the very bad part. The earbuds worked great and I was using it for 1-2 days and they ran out of charge (as they should) but they wouldn’t recharge. Tried every trouble shooting step listed on the website but didn’t work. Of course buying Bose from Amazon means you have two super customer obsessed companies and Amazon customer service offered a replacement next day. I am on my second set, so far things seem to be working fine.","Reviewed in India on 29 September 2022","Edited after 13 months- DONT BUY THIS- It doesn’t last long","1.0 out of 5 stars","","46","Triple Black"

"R82AWIXRMOXMR","JR","This product is a great example of designed obsolescence. For the first year it was a blessing to my ND self. I told people that everyone diagnosed with ADHD and ASD should get a pair when they got diagnosed. My productivity shot way up. And then the designed obsolescence kicked in.Problems started around the year mark when the charging case snapped. From then on I've had to tape it shut. The battery life went from about 8 hours to 4.5. And worse, whether or not it charges seems to depend on some arcane algorithm you have no real power over.See, there's no switch to set it to power mode. You can put them back in the case, but SURPRISE! it only pretends to charge. You'll grab them five hours later only to find them flashing red. And when you use them for accessibility that means you'll lose an entire day of work.If I had to put a number to it I'd say they charge maybe 70% of the time. Enough that you'll try to get them to work, but not enough to be reliable. You can have them in the case, plugged in, and the stupid algorithm will just decide not to charge.It's a problem that could have been fixed with a tiny switch, but such things are solutions for a different era. And besides, they want you to buy a new pair every year!

"RC0YRK8WRV88J","Federico Giustarini Chiara Lusini","Bose qualità ottima del suono, nessun dubbio su questo. Auricolari adatti per attività sportiva anche impegnativa: una volta inseriti, non si staccano nemmeno se si rotola giù da un precipizio. Il suono è pieno, il volume arriva a livelli più che sufficienti, le regolazioni touch funzionano tutto sommato bene (a volte è necessario ripetere più di una volta). Cancellazione rumore esterno è buona: non ho termini di paragone essendo questo il mio primo dispositivo di questo tipo. I rumori vengono attenuati moltissimo, è chiaro che i miracoli non esistono e si ci si trova in un ingorgo con auto strombazzanti è difficile che non passi proprio niente. La nota dolentissima, per degli auricolari di questo tipo, da utilizzare anche per chiamare, è la qualità del suono in uscita: a meno di non essere in una stanza vuota e silenziosa, il vostro interlocutore continuerà a imprecare e maledirvi (più o meno esplicitamente) per tutta la durata della conversazione. Camminare per strada e tentare una chiamata con questi auricolari è una pia illusione: dovrete per forza passare all'audio del telefono e tenervelo attaccato all'orecchio. Anche qui, non ci si possono aspettare dei miracoli, ma da un prodotto di eccellenza che costa quasi 300 euro è lecito attendersi qualcosa di meglio, per lo meno che riesca a riprodurre la stessa qualità del telefono al quale è attaccato. No ho termini di paragone nemmeno per questo aspetto, ma da qualche recensione spulciata qua e là mi è parso di capire che in giro c'è molto di meglio. . .  peccato, perché per me Bose rappresenta l'eccellenza e questa è stata una mezza delusione.","Reviewed in Italy on 26 August 2023","Se ascolti, bene.

"RQ07WMVAC8SJ3","Camilo","Had few Bose headphones in the past and I was really looking forward to this earphones. For being a Bose product I was expecting an absolute magnificent product, but unfortunately ended up being a big massive disappointment. Great earphones to listen music if you are indoors or normally walking outside. The noise cancellation works fine in this calm scenarios. But nothing else. Pairing with iPhone and other devices is quiet slow and most of the time you have to wear both in order to connect automatically with your phone. Or  you will have to go to settings in your phone to be able to connect to them as I mentioned before pairing automatically is not great. The quiet setting is worthless if you are running or riding a bicycle as you can hear the noise of the wind through your ears and you can forget about listening to what you were listening as the only thing you will hear will be a constant howling wind. Case is quiet big and a bit uncomfortable to have it inside your trouser pockets you will ended up keeping inside you bag or backpack but no somewhere as easy access as your pocket. Don’t get me wrong battery is great. One full charge last me around 2 full days. Listening music several hours a day. Perfect pair of earphones if you are studying and need to focus or relaxing in bed and you just want to chill and absorb the great sound. Definitely not recommended to use it as hands free device as the quality of the sound is not great and you always will sound as you are meters away from the microphone when talking to someone.  Also the price…Bose is never cheap. But I have to say this is the first time I actually believe this product it’s not worth the price. If you can get them for less than £100 definitely go for them but more than that you can seriously get better product with some other brands…","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 June 2023","Very Disappointed…","2.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/810pxXmqSXL.jpg

"R2BOJW9ZY4F6Z0","Harry","The Bose QuietComfort® Earbuds undoubtedly live up to the brand's reputation for exceptional sound quality and industry-leading noise cancellation. However, despite their impressive features, the sizing of these fully wireless Bluetooth earbuds leaves something to be desired. Here's a detailed review:Superior Noise Cancellation: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Bose has mastered the art of noise cancellation, and the QuietComfort® Earbuds are a testament to this expertise. The noise cancellation is highly effective, creating a serene audio environment even in bustling surroundings. The ability to immerse oneself in music or calls without external disruptions is a standout feature.Impeccable Sound Quality: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐The sound quality is exceptional, delivering rich, clear, and immersive audio. Whether enjoying music, podcasts, or making calls, the Bose QuietComfort® Earbuds provide an unparalleled audio experience that lives up to the brand's high standards.Fully Wireless Convenience: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐The convenience of fully wireless earbuds cannot be overstated. The absence of tangled wires enhances the overall user experience, offering freedom of movement without compromising audio quality. The Bluetooth connectivity is reliable and seamless.Voice Control Integration: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐The inclusion of voice control adds a layer of convenience to the user experience. With voice-activated features, it's easy to manage calls, adjust volume, or access virtual assistants without reaching for the device. This hands-free capability is a thoughtful addition.Sizing Concerns: ⭐⭐ (2/5)Unfortunately, the Bose QuietComfort® Earbuds fall short in the sizing department. The earbuds are notably larger than other options in the market, making them uncomfortable for extended use. The fit may not be ideal for individuals with smaller ears, leading to concerns about stability during activities such as running or working out.Comfort and Ergonomics: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)While the overall build quality is commendable, the comfort level is compromised for users with smaller ears. The earbuds may feel bulky and less secure, impacting the extended wear comfort. Bose could improve the design to cater to a wider range of ear sizes.Overall Verdict: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)In conclusion, the Bose QuietComfort® Earbuds offer superior noise cancellation, impeccable sound quality, and convenient features like voice control. However, the sizing concerns, particularly for users with smaller ears, are a significant drawback. The earbuds' comfort and ergonomics could be improved to ensure a better fit for a diverse range of users. Despite the exceptional audio experience, the sizing limitations warrant a 3/5 rating. If Bose addresses the sizing issue in future iterations, these earbuds could easily achieve a higher rating for an all-encompassing premium audio experience.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 December 2023","Bose QuietComfort® Earbuds - Superior Noise Cancellation, but Sizing Falls Short","3.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Triple Black"
"R1PS99Y7GVC6NG","M","Es gibt ja nun ein ganzes Meer von Kopfhörern, aber ich habe mich für Bose entschieden, da ich hier bisher noch nie von der Qualität und Langlebigkeit enttäuscht wurde, da bezahle ich auch gern etwas mehr. Ich bin allerdings nicht vollkommen zufrieden. Eines vorweg: das Einzige, was ich absolut großartig finde, ist die Soundqualität, also das wichtigste funktioniert sehr gut!Ich habe zusätzlich die großen Bose QC35 Kopfhörer (2017), aber gerade für den Sommer wollte ich etwas anderes, wo einem nicht so heiß drunter wird. Ich ziehe diese Kopfhörer nun als Vergleich hinzu.Was die Soundqualität angeht, so stehen die kleinen Stöpsel den großen Kopfhörern in nichts, nach, das hat mich sehr überrascht!Doch was ist nicht so toll? Zum einen die App. Als ich sie installierte (3x, weil sich die Verbindung einfach nicht aufbauen wollte) waren im Menü die Möglichkeiten aufgelistet, was man tolles damit anstellen kann (z.B. was passiert, wenn ich tippe, wische, etc.) Also ich persönlich kann es nicht ausstehen, irgendetwas mit der App zu bedienen, daher bin ich sehr froh, dass man darauf auch verzichten kann! Was am Anfang funktioniert hat, war die Abstufung des Noise Cancelling (per App), doch aus irgendeinem Grund, den ich als absoluter Technik-Depp einfach noch nicht erkennen konnte, wird dies nun nicht mehr angezeigt. Das bedeutet, es gibt nur ganz oder gar nicht. Das Ganz ist aber um einiges Besser, als beim CQ35, hier hat man doch den Vorteil, dass etwas direkt im Ohr steckt und der Außenwelt Lebewohl sagen kann. Sehr schön :)Die Bluetooth-Verbindung baut sich brav auf, sobald man die Stöpsel im Ohr hat. Manchmal hackelt die Verbindung allerdings, das könnte aber auch am Handy liegen. Mit meinen großen Kopfhörern habe ich dieses Problem allerdings nicht.Was die Passform angeht, so passt der eine Stöpsel sehr gut, der andere fällt mir fast aus dem Ohr raus. ich habe alle mitgelieferten Größen durchprobiert, ist nichts zu machen... Zum Rennen finde ich sie daher nicht geeignet.Ich würde es nach den 3-4 Monaten Benutzung als Hassliebe bezeichnen.","Reviewed in Germany on 8 December 2023","Ich wollte mich nicht aufregen, das hat so halb geklappt...","3.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Triple Black"

The battery life is also a little lackluster: won't take you through a plane trip of continuous listening, though if you charge them in the case they last at least most of the day.I would very much recommend looking for newer models with a flatter case, better battery, and possibly better noise cancelling and sound though those were always the strongpoint of this product.I'll be attempting to get some sort of at least partial refund since 3y is not really an acceptable service life for a product at this price range, however if I don't get one I can't be too upset with the value I got.","Reviewed in Canada on 7 December 2023","Broke after 3 years of use, decent but outdated","3.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Triple Black"

It's a simple review anyway, which applies to both models. The sound is great, but everything else is unreliable. I am glad that Bose have twice replaced faulty units, but ideally this wouldn't happen at all. Even the current pair that are working ok still have issues - the left earpiece sometimes doesn't connect unless I put that one in first, and they seem vulnerable to interference from Bluetooth or electrical activity, with crackles and pops happening. Meanwhile my AirPods are nowhere near as good sound-wise, but at least they are robust and reliable. The Bose earbuds also slide out of my ear, even having tried all the bits of rubber in different combinations - but I have a pair of reasonable-sounding Sony WF-C700Ns that sit and hold really well. The quest for the holy grail of reliable, great-sounding earbuds that stay put in my ears goes on.

"RE4MLMOFHK8O2","A Discerning Customer","These earbuds sound great. I love how these sound. My issue is with BOSE requiring you to download an app so that can use basic functions such as skipping and volume controls. And of course you have to fork over your personal information first before connecting the earbuds.  In order to use the touch feature to raise & lower the volume (without having to use your phone) you must use the app. It took a long time for the app to connect correctly to the earbuds. You can connect directly to the earbuds with your phone but cannot use the functions. As far as being able to skip songs, you have to setup a shortcut in the app. Skipping back is not allowed. You can adjust the noise cancellation in the app or on the buds themselves. However, should you touch the left earbud it will change the cancellation to let in more noise. Using these buds takes a while to get used them.What bothers me most is that an app is required to use basic functions. The manufacturer is just looking to sell our personal information & data. There is no need for an app.","Reviewed in the United States on 18 March 2023","Great Sound but.....","3.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Triple Black"
"R6380PYEUIOQM","Time2Fly","Bose makes a great sounding earbud- absolutely NO doubts there, and it fits perfectly.However, as noted with Bose earbuds, these always had to be reconnected to my brand new pixel 7 pro phone. If you put the earbuds in, you'd have to reconnect them thru the Bose app which was incredibly frustrating, sometimes taking many minutes and attempts.  Additionally, you cannot tap the earbud to go forward and also go backward- in otherwords you have to chose in the app settings for the touch controls if you want a double tap to be for going forward a song or back a song... this is arguably the most frustrating issue with these buds. I returned mine after unboxing it for all of 30 minutes (mostly spent re-connecting them). Was going to buy the newer Bose earbuds but those are fraught with customers complaining about connectivity.  My $50 JBL's from 3 years ago are still solid, always connected, decent sound and let me jump around with noise canceling.

"R1AYP0HOBSHKBQ","MzSylvan85","Cons: I have had a pair of Bose headphones in the past that wear amazing, but these were not what I expected. This pair did not meet my expectations. My main problem is you must use the right earbud to get sound. The left earbud is not programmable to be use by itself. Even if you could use them separately, the battery life depletes simultaneously. The app for the earbuds did not provide any way to use the left earbud on its own it to use the earbuds separately. As a person who multitasks, I use one earbud until it dies and then switch. I have a small child and don’t wear both while doing chores, errands, or just around the house. My second problem was the need for the Beats Connect app to constantly update. I only had them for maybe a week and every time I’m in the app it’s updating. And lastly, no capability to locate individual earbuds.Pros: These are excellent for people with small ears, the design takes some getting used to. The noise cancellation works! I have to remove the single earbud in order to hear clearly. These would work better for me when I used to go to the gym or when I’m cooking and need to detach from my surrounding noise.I typically don’t leave poor reviews but wanted to give a review that I wish I could have seen prior to my purchase.

"R29MCUXQACS02Z","Lorenzo","Ho comprato gli auricolari Quietcomfort Earbuds di prima generazione perché mi ero trovato benissimo con gli auricolari Bose col filo: gli inserti StayHear sono comodissimi e gli auricolari restano stabilissimi nell'orecchio qualsiasi movimento si faccia.Inclusi nella confezione ci sono tre taglie di StayHear Max (0, 1+ e 2+), ma Bose ne produce ben sette taglie: 0, 1, 1+, 2, 2+, 3 (purtroppo da ordinare direttamente da Bose, non sono venduti su Amazon).Purtroppo la seconda generazione (Quietcomfort Earbuds II) non ha più gli inserti StayHear, ed è un grosso peccato perché erano la parte migliore di questi auricolari...Per quanto riguarda tutto il resto... sono deluso.Innanzitutto c'è spesso un lieve disallineamento temporale tra auricolare destro e sinistro, che fa sembrare che l'audio ""oscilli"" tra destra e sinistra. Si sente chiaramente quando si ascolta un podcast o comunque una voce che dovrebbe essere ben centrata sul piano stereofonico, ma invece sembra muoversi a zig zag. È lieve ma percettibile, e quando lo si nota distrae ed infastidisce. Il problema è presente con tutti i dispositivi che ho provato (smartphone, PC e tablet).Altro problema è la mancanza del Bluetooth multipoint: non è possibile avere collegati contemporaneamente telefono e PC. Per commutare tra i diversi dispositivi accoppiati bisogna premere il tasto Bluetooth dentro la custodia.Essendo un dispositivo di prima generazione tutto è molto grosso: sia gli auricolari che la custodia. Almeno la durata della batteria è buona.La qualità del suono è appena accettabile (considerato quanto costano). Purtroppo Bose non supporta codec ad alta qualità, ed i limiti del codec SBC rendono la qualità dell'ascolto molto deludente.La qualità della cancellazione del rumore è discreta, ma le mie aspettative erano ben più alte visto il costo... appena accettabile la qualità dell'audio catturato dal microfono durante una telefonata o una videoconferenza.In definitiva, grazie agli inserti StayHear Max questi auricolari hanno eccezionale comodità e stabilità, migliori di qualsiasi altro auricolare in commercio (inclusa la loro seconda generazione, che non è all'altezza). Per tutto il resto, accettabili ma deludenti, e non valgono il prezzo.","Reviewed in Italy on 28 February 2023","Complessivamente deludenti","3.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Triple Black"

"R39P2K4DLEZG1V","PJ","I bought these with great anticipation, very pleased with sound quality and noise cancelation. Then the ear buds would randomly pop out, from snug and secure to out of my ear in an instant. But I'm sure that's just my physiology, I've had trouble with this style in the past and have learned to buy ear buds and other Bluetooth devices that loop over the ear. I hoped Bose might have a secret design that might work for me, but no.So in the last year, I've used them maybe 50 times around the house to not interrupt others with the media I consume.About a month ago, the left earbud developed a constant white noise, regardless of whether I had any audio playing or not. Maybe I would have noticed it sooner, but the noise canceling is VERY good and I still like to hear my surroundings and (this was a large disappointment) the left ear cannot be utilized independently from the right. Meaning, I can't use the left without the right, but the right can be used without the left, so with the aforementioned superior noise canceling and my desire to be cognizant of my surroundings, the left rarely got used.Then, the charging port stopped working. I'm not sure why, the case doesn't see much abuse because I don't use the product outside of my house since I can't trust them to stay in my ear.

"R22BSKHJTKURBV","Brett S. Clendaniel","I love everything about these buds but they do have hiccups. First the good. They sound fantastic. Noise cancelling is fantastic. The way they lock into my ears is fantastic. Once you put them in your ear, you twist them and they are locked in. Now for the bad but after 2 months of frustration, I stumbled upon a simple setting adjustment and it’s fixed. I’m not sure why they started messing up but one day I was wearing them while riding my lawnmower and they kept trying to connect to Siri non stop. Then my right bud quit working. I shut off everything Siri related in my phone but my ear buds still kept trying to connect to it. I gave up wearing them until today. In the Bose app there’s a setting to turn off “in ear detection”. I now have both buds working with no disruptions. I have no clue why I needed to change this setting but it fixed them so I’m happy.

"R2X10BBQYH1V5O","Amazon Customer","These Bose Quiet comfort headphones were incredible. Good sound, comfortable fit, long battery life. I debated getting these for about a year before I finally bought them. I normally lose my headphones so I wasn’t sure if I wanted to spend this much on a set. I did and I was so happy with the quality. Up until the point I was dancing on my long board listening to the sweet sounds of music. I road over a wet bridge and the moment I remembered to be careful riding on wet wood, my board slid out from underneath me. Both ear buds flew out of my ears. One of them I was able to find, but the other fell off the bridge into a river. After about 10-15 minutes of trying to find it, I lost connection and gave up. Sadly Bose was unable to help. I’ll probably upgrade to the ultimate eventually. Don’t make the same mistake I made. If you fall really hard, they will fly out. I only had them a little over a month but enjoyed every minute.

"R2FNRNSS1DTYWT","Alex Drolshagen","The great:- Earbuds rest in your earlobe via the interchangeable silicone wingtip jackets. They're designed to rest on the edge of your ear canal rather than inserted and expanded. This alleviates a lot of common discomfort and ear fatigue I experience with traditional earbuds. Sometimes I forget I've even got them in.- The active noise canceling is much more effective than the active noise canceling I experienced with the Samsung Buds 2.- Touch and Gesture actions are responsive and accurate.- Sound is the quality one could expect from Bose (if you like Bose sound, you'll like these. If you don't like Bose sound, then this is a con).- Battery capacity allows for long periods of being outside of the charging case. The case itself seems to hold a large capacity as well.- Bluetooth range is fairly distant allowing for the audio source to be a fair bit away. No specifics but I've been at least 100ft away and still hear audio from my phone.- Case is charged via USB-C (provided) OR wireless Qi charging (not provided).The Not-So-Great:- The left earbud is dependent on the right earbud. If the right earbud is left in the case and the case is closed, the left earbud cannot connect to your device. The case MUST be open I'm order to connect the right earbud to the device and thus act as a conduit for the left earbud. Frustrating at first but I've found that this doesn't actually bother me as much as it sounds. There really aren't any times I can think of where the case with the right earbud will not be nearby.- Bulky case. I see this also as a minimal drawback since the earbuds themselves are fairly large in size due to the active noise-canceling tech, the silicone wingtip jackets, and the seemingly large batter capacity.- Required Mobile App. I understand to a degree the because of Bose's technology a mobile app would allow for full customization of the settings of their devices, but the fact that it requires an account to use the app is frustrating and unnecessary.","Reviewed in the United States on 15 June 2023","Comfortable, effective, bulky case, required mobile app","4.0 out of 5 stars","","2","Triple Black"

"R1Q8L3ZIT70EPA","Bob","I purchased these a little over 2 years ago. About 70% of the time it can take up to 5 minutes to pair with my iPhone. Needless to say it’s very frustrating. I talked with Bose several times to no avail. They are awesome earbuds but can be such a hassle sometimes. I’m currently shopping for earbuds again since there is 2 plus years of newer technology. Was almost set on Sony WF-1000XM4 but not sure. Still think Bose QC ll might be better than Sony but they might still have the same issue as the original Quiet Comfort that I’ve got. I’ve seen other reviews with this same issue. I just removed one star for the pairing issue otherwise I would have given it more than five stars if possible.Update: July 23, 2023I didn’t mention in my original review that Bose replaced my QC Earbuds about 10 months after I purchased them with a pair of refurbished ones that was fine with me but they are also difficult to pair with my iPhone. After quite a bit of research I’ve just about decided on Beats Fit Pro. I’ve tried AirPod Pros which of course pair great with iPhone but are not quite as good as Bose and I don’t care for the stems. The Beats should pair great also since they are Apple. With the Beats Fit Pro I feel that I will give up a bit of quality but I’m done with the pairing issue.

"R13S6PD0ROGTOT","David Skapura","The list of positives about this product is too long to detail here... they just work!  The sound quality is outstanding, the noise cancellation modes allow everything from off to fully quiet, and - most importantly - they fit my ear canal!  My biggest fear with expensive earbuds is that they'll fall out and roll into a completely inaccessible location while seated in an airplane.  I don't have that fear with these, as the 'locking mechanism' holds the earbud in place without relying entirely on the friction fit of the earpiece.The only negative I have with it is that the app that Bose provides to pair and configure the earbuds (and other Bose products) is only Android and iOS compatible.  While it is possible to pair these earbuds with a Windows laptop, the process is not a standard BT search, pair operation.  On the first (several) tries, the earbuds were found by the laptop, but paired with it as a non-audio device.  After some web research, and a driver update, I was able to make it work... but it really shouldn't have been that difficult.","Reviewed in the United States on 18 May 2023","Best noise cancelling earbuds I've ever used...","4.0 out of 5 stars","","5","Triple Black"

"R2QZSQEBGC1NAV","E. Lopez","Ok so the noise cancelation is the killer feature for SURE!! BUT the caveat is when you pull one or the other out to talk to someone it keeps playing the music or video. NOT a deal breaker by any means just kind of annoying.  Also double tap right ear to stop music etc. I have dry hands so controls seem to work better when there is some moisture on your finger tips. The different size ear tips hold them in great. But you will need to get use to them if you wear them for an extended amount of time. I bought these and went on a roadtrip right away. So like a baseball glove I ""broke"" my ears in lol. Now they don't bother me anymore after hours of being in my ear. Yes they are big but tbh I've asked my friends if they look weird and they said no . So not as small as my galaxy buds 2 (GARBAGE) that I had since they came out. Why the switch well the galaxy buds 2 have a case that the lid does not click shut like the Bose. So I had them on a carabiner and played a game of kickball at a birthday party.  Went home and to my surprise both buds were gone... Did a bunch of research and didn't want to spend more than $100 on new buds.  Ultimately I took a chance on these solely because I value noise cancelling so much.  I could not be happier!!! JUST get them and try them for 7 days I promise you will love them.  The only other drawback is the size of the storage case. I bought a case for the case so I can clip it to my belt loop but it's big and kind of awkward. The work around is now I just clip it to my always with me 64oz Bubba water bottle.  So if you leave your water bottle behind on occasion and your buds are in. Guess what, when you go to pull them out you won't have anywhere to store them. Because the case is in the car with the water bottle lol.

I previously had Galaxy Buds Live that advertise ANC, but it didn't really work for me.What I didn't love was the  bone conduction effect.  I got the ""thump thump"" noise while walking or otherwise being active.  It seems like that's the trade off -- a complete seal provides great ANC, but you may experience that echoing noise each time you take a step.I read that this effect can be minimized by wearing a bigger tip.  I noticed some improvement while still getting ANC benefits, but while active I noticed looseness and had to catch one.  So not a great ""fix"".These also felt a bit bulky in my ears.  The case is also quite large, and so if you like to keep a case in your pocket, that could be a problem.For me comfort and versatility outweigh sound quality and ANC.  But if the latter two are what you are looking for, this would be a great choice, and I assume the next generation is even better.","Reviewed in the United States on 24 April 2023","Great for noise cancellation and sound; not as great when you are on the move.","4.0 out of 5 stars","","2","Triple Black"

"R3L5E6BZDV5DCV","GDC","I was a little hasty when making my first review. First of all, the Bose sound quality is good as usual.1. I expected the noise cancelling to be the same as over the ear headphones and it is not the same (because it is not over the ear), however, it is good once you select the right ear clips. It appears that the noise cancelling for these ear buds are not expected to be completely silent but they are not. I still hear voices but do not hear ambient noise which is good. That works better when you are at the grocery store.2. The sound quality is great as usual BUT you have to adjust the EQ in the app. Once I adjusted the frequencies to my liking it was the same old Bose quality that I expect.3. The ear clips can be more comfortable. I have other Bose earbud head phones and they are a lot better. I tried different sizes but they are just not comfortable to me. This is why I did not rate this a 5.All in all these are great earbuds for the first generation. You can not go wrong with Bose!Original ReviewI've had several Bose products including noise cancellation headphones. Keep in mind this is the first version of this product, but I was somewhat disappointed. My over the ear head phones are much better (sound, noise cancellation...etc).

"R14OD49KQWOX6O","Amazon Kunde","Ich kann endlich wieder außerhalb der Wohnung mit Kopfhörern telefonieren, ohne dass der andere die Geräusche 10x so laut hört!Habe mich lange geweigert was anderes als AirPods zu kaufen, aber es war einfach nicht mehr tragbar. Die Tonqualität beim Musik hören ist insgesamt etwas schwächer als bei den AirPods, aber immer noch super. Das Noise cancelling hält auch mit den AirPods mit. Hier kann man auch zwischen mehreren Stufen des Noise cancellings unterteilen und sich sogar eigene Modi einstellen. Manchmal trennt sich die Bluetooth Verbindung wenn man nur einen Kopfhörer trägt. Ansonsten ist sie aber stabil. Das Design ist leider etwas auffälliger als bei den AirPods, aber dafür sind sie bequemer(Achtung sucht euch unbedingt die richtige Größe für euer Ohr aus.

"R3T1G8R0Z2PVNH","DS","This product has great ANC. It did not work for me as my ear shape did not allow for the silicone “hook” to hold the earbud securely against my conchal bowl. As a result the earbud would slide out whenever I turned my head. Also, the silicone “hook” and ear canal seal are one piece so you have limited flexibility to match your anatomy,ie small canal but larger bowl, etc.  If the surface of your conchal bowl that supports the “hook” is angled away from your ear, the earbud will slide out as the ear canal piece seems to only for sound sealing purposes.

"R1N2BKYBJTOSFU","Gaurav Sharma","I have been using Bose soundsports for past couple of years and have no complaint except a button broke and they sent me new sets immediately. So working from home needed buds with active noice cancellation. Did a lot of research .. saw that there are other headphones that produce better sound for music but that wasnt my priority. Noise cancellation is very good.. I stand outside by the road and it effectively removes the sound of vendors yelling or vehicles on road. I can also take calls in my car with all background noise cancelled. No sounds from home filter through to the other party.Are these good for listening to music.. yes their sound does not make you feel tired... do they do justice to the sound recreation.. not really.... but are you buying these cos you are audiophile?? when you wont buy buds anyways..I added one more work mode to the two existing modes of transparent and quiet.. can double tap left headphone to change mode. Removing one of the buds automatically puts them in transparency mode. Range is way better than my soundsports. The voice call is quite close to natural unlike most of the other brands which make you sound robotic.I got a very good offer on Amazon which was 10% off and using the interest free installment option i was able to effectively get these under 23k.If calls matter..or even you want some peace.. you must absolutely go for these.","Reviewed in India on 19 November 2021","Life saver for people who work from home or in noisy office","5.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61R8BVXzILL.jpg","2","Soapstone"

"R2XJME5761LM08","NM","Very positively surprised with this pair. BOSE has implemented fantastic ANC here, and with reasonably good audio quality (vs peer set). Best part (which got me sold on it) - is you dont have to push it deep into the ear canal, which was massively uncomfortable for me with other brands. These settle well into the ear, without needing to be pushed inside, and deliver great ANC even with this level of passive isolation. The transparency mode is brilliant as well. Call quality (mic) - is better than all other TW earbuds. Size is slightly larger, but not a dealbreaker for me.NOTE: Do ensure you use the latest firmware/app (BOSE MUSIC) - volume control on earbuds, EQ available in APP, various levels of ANC can be set up.","Reviewed in India on 6 October 2021","Fantastic earbuds, great ANC, great sound","5.0 out of 5 stars","","3","Triple Black"

This probably is an issue with class D amps used in speakers like Marshall Woburn II which I happen to use and know it but this was not expected from these.- These are neither that bass-heavy like the Powerbeats Pro nor as detailed as the Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 2.Believe me you won’t find it worth the spend.","Reviewed in India on 14 October 2020","Not that loud","1.0 out of 5 stars","","131","Triple Black"

"R3SM0ZCFPPUR8B","S. Schlager","MoinIch habe mir diese Bose QuietComfort Earbuds gekauft als neu Anschaffung meiner schon auseinanderfallenden Bose Soundsport. Der erste Eindruck war ernüchternd, besser gesagt enttäuschend. Sound mässig sind Sie gegenüber Soundsport um weiten besser, keine Frage. Nur irgendwie werde ich mit dem Bass nicht richtig warm, was beim Sport nach meiner Meinung her, wichtig ist. Da können die Bose Soundsport es besser. Nach Anfrage an Bose Forum, ob etwas am Sound verändert wurde, hieß es nur: Es wurde nichts verändert, alles sei gleich geblieben. Ansonsten einfach zur Reparatur einschicken lassen. Diesen Satz: Einfach zur Reparatur einschicken lassen, lese ich bei fast jeden thread, von egal welchen Problemen. Klingt so als würden die Ihr Produkt selbst nicht trauen. Des Weiteren sind mir folgende Mangel in den letzten 2 Monaten aufgefallen:Nachteil/Mangel:1. Die eingebauten Magnete zum Schutz vorm rausfallen, sind zu schwach. Leichtes Schütteln sorgt schon dafür das die herausfallen, ganz anders als bei den Sony WF-1000XM3,2. Die Verbindung muss ständig beim ersten Mal Benutzung, (egal ob es 1 Woche her ist oder 1 Tag nur) neu verbunden werden. Da mein IPhone 12 Pro diese nie automatisch findet. Nicht so wie bei den Bose Soundsport oder Sony WF-1000XM3. Beim hinsetzen in der Bahn/Bus, bei der Arbeit oder sonst wo, bricht der Sound ständig ab und beginnt erst dann wieder weiter zu laufen, wenn man sein Handy aus der Hosentasche nimmt. (Verbindungsprobleme) Ob es an Bose oder am IPhone liegt weiß ich nicht. Diese Probleme hatte ich bei meinen Bose Soundsport nie.4. Mir ist es schon drei mal passiert, dass der Linke Earbuds leiser war als der Rechte, besonders merkbar war das lauter und leiser machen, da der Rechte beim leise machen, leiser wurde gegenüber den linke der Lauter wurde (vertauschte Einstellung)5. Großer Manko ist aber das Ladecase/Ladeschale. Mal von der Größe abgesehen, solltet ihr das Ladecase/ladeschale mal verlieren, könnt ihr die Earbuds gleich wegschmeißen. Da ihrA: Keine neuen Ladecase/Ladeschale kaufen könntB: Technik eingebaut ist, die nur für eure Earbuds abgestimmt ist/nur für diese, eure Earbuds funktionieren.6. Die üblichen verdächtigen:- man kann die QuietComfort nicht mit zwei Geräten gleichzeitig paaren (bei Bose Soundsport ging es)- Das Design ist schick, aber viel zu groß in der Hosentasche sieht es aus als hätte man eine Beule oder ein Tumor.- Die Touchbedienung ist ein graus. Jabra hat es viel besser gelöst. Das laut leiser drüber wischen ist zu stark eingestellt, schnell hat man es zu laut oder zu leise eingestellt. Man kann beim Linken Earbuds nur zwischen 3 Modi entscheiden: Akkuabfrage, vorwärts springen oder Rückwärts springen.- Zur App gibt es auch nicht viel zu sagen, es ist zwar einiges da, aber andere sehen schöner aus oder bieten eventuell etwas mehr. Meiner Meinung her (Vergleich mit Sony und Jabra) des Weiteren kann man die Bose Soundsport nicht mit der neuen App benutzen (Bose Musik) und anders rum mit denn Quiet Comfort kann man nicht die alte App benutzen (Bose Connect) so gesehen muss ich beide Bose apps drauf haben.(Bose Musik für QuietComfort und Bose Connect für Soundsport)- Das Verbinden zwischen Handy und Earbuds ist auch so eine Sache mal klappt es mal nicht. Zum Glück macht man das nur einmal.- beim ersten Mal Tragen taten die nach circa 1 Stunde weh. Wie damals die Bose Soundsport. Die Passformen sind auch etwas anders als die von Soundsport. Das kann man als Positiv als auch als Negativ sehen. Ich hätte mich auch über die alte Passform gefreut, hatte nie Probleme damit.- Der mit gelieferte Kabel ist viel zu kurz. Das war damals schon so und das ist heute auch noch so, Schade. Ein Netzteil-Ledegerät wäre bei einen Preis von 220-250€ auch nett gewesen.Jetzt mal zum Positiven:1. Der Sound ist besser als die damaligen Bose Soundsports. Wobei ja nichts am Sound verändert wurde. Nicht war Bose? 😉2. Zu Noise-Cancelling kann ich nicht viel sagen, da ich selbst nie welche besaß. Ich kann nur so viel dazu sagen: In der Stadt mit Noise-Cancelling hört man die Menschenmasse gar nichts mehr. Was anderes ist es, wenn man brüllt, die Bahn stark bremmst, auf einer Mechanischen Tastatur tippt oder irgendwo anders Musik laut gespielt wird. Das hört man zwar, aber auch leise gedämpft. Das kann man aber verschmerzen, wenn man Musik hört. (Leise Musik hören reicht schon aus)3. Die Update Zeit dauert nicht so lange wie so manch anderer Hersteller.4. Die Ladezeit, wie soll man das beschreiben, nun ja, erst werden die Earbuds geladen dann das Case. Nach 15 Min kann man durch Schnellladefunktion 2 Std hören. Das Case/Ladeschale besitzt QI Standart. (Induktions-Charger) praktisch es mal über Nacht laden zu lassen.5. Das Design sieht edel und hochwertig aus, trotz Plastikverarbeitung. Es werden fünf auflade LED angezeigt, (Weis) zum Akkustand des Ladecases/Ladeschale. Es werden je drei Aufsätze mitgeliefert S/M/L. M ist schon dran. Einfach ausprobieren, was passt.6. Für Sport auch geeignet Sie sitzen (bei mir) fest und haben eine Schutzklasse von IPX4 Verifizierung. (Schutz vor Schweiß und Spritzwasser) Nur Schwimmen würde ich mit den Dingern nicht. Auch die Größe der Earbuds sind etwas zu bemängeln, sie sind etwas größer als die Bose Sport Earbuds. Dennoch besitzen Sie gegenüber den Sport Earbuds Noise-Cancelling, was so mancher Männer stöhnen dämpft. 👍Fazit. Entscheidet selbst ob sich der Kauf lohnt oder nicht.","Reviewed in Germany on 19 October 2021","Mehr schein als sein.","2.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Soapstone"
"R2FH2TY1PI55ZF","Carsten Wandschura","Ich habe mir verschiedene Earbuds zum Testen gekauft, da andere Bewertungen immer sehr subjektiv sind und ich mir lieber ein eigenes Bild machen wollte:Jabra Elite 4, Soundcore Space A40, Denon AH-C830WNC, Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, Soundcore Liberty Pro 3, Sony WF-1000XM4.Da ich keinen detaillierten Produkttest zu jedem der Produkte schreiben will, belasse ich es bei den wesentlichen Punkten, die mir besonders gut bzw. nicht gut gefallen haben. Als Referenz für den Sound diente ein Sony WH-1000XM3 over ear Kopfhörer. Getestet habe ich mit dem Lied „Eivør – Falling Free (live in Torshavn)“, welches nichts anderes als die beste Soundqualität verdient.Vorweg: Die Bedienbarkeit hat mir bei allen Modellen sehr gut gefallen. Ebenfalls verfügten alle Geräte, soweit nicht anders angegeben, über eine stabile Bluetoothverbindung. Das NC war bei allen Geräten, wenn nicht anders angegeben, sehr enttäuschend.Jabra Elite 4-----------------------------------------------Im Vergleich zu den meisten anderen getesteten Earbuds sind diese besonders leicht und haben einen sehr bequemen Sitz. Leider wirken sie und das Ladecase nicht hochwertig. Bereits die Verpackung, die aus Pappe besteht und stellenweise Beschädigungen aufwies, machte keinen hochwertigen Eindruck. Der Sound hat mit dem geworbenen „superior Sound“ absolut nichts zu tun. Für mich war dies das Schlechteste der getesteten Produkte. Man muss dazu sagen, dass es auch das günstigste Produkt ist und es gegenüber den andren einfach untergeht. Dennoch bin ich der Meinung, dass meine alten 20€ Mpows einen besseren Klang hatten.Soundcore Space A40-----------------------------------------------Diese Earbuds sind ebenfalls sehr leicht und daher besonders bequem zu tragen. Der Sound hat für mich ebenfalls nichts mit dem geworbenen High-resolution Audio nichts zu tun. Die Material- und Verarbeitungsqualität hat mich sehr überzeugtDenon AH-C830WNC-----------------------------------------------Das Gesamtfazit ist nahezu identisch zu den Soundcore Space A40. Wenn das Ladecase aufgeklappt ist, fehlt nicht mehr viel, sodass es nach hinten umkippt. Es ist für mich unverständlich, wie dieser hohe Kaufpreis zustande kommt.Bose QuietComfort Earbuds-----------------------------------------------Bei dem Preis und der Marke war ich vom Sound extrem enttäuscht. Die Bluetooth-Verbindung war sehr instabil, sodass ich regelmäßig Verbindungsabbrüche hatte. Das NC war gefühlt nicht vorhanden. Die Buds sind so extrem klobig und überdimensioniert (Bilder Bose vs. Sony), sodass der Sitz sehr unsicher war. Ich hatte stets das Gefühl, dass mir die Buds jederzeit aus dem Ohr fallen. Das Ladecase ist mit Abstand das größte. Ob man das als gut oder schlecht befindet, ist jedem selbst überlassen. Es ist mir auch hier ein Rätsel, wie der hohe Preis zustande kommt. In Sachen Preis-Leistung sind die Bose für mich die klaren Verlierer.Bis hier konnten die Buds meinen Ansprüchen leider in keiner Weise gerecht werden, weshalb ich kein Ranking abgeben kann und möchte. Man muss dazu sagen, dass man sich an den schlechten Sound mit der Zeit gewöhnt und er irgendwann normal klingt. Aber das sollte hier nicht mein Anspruch sein.Sind nun alle Geräte Schrott oder qualitativ minderwertig? Natürlich nicht, wobei mich alle Produkte nicht zu 100% überzeugen konnten, aber zu 95% 😉! Hier stachen 2 Geräte mit haushohen Abstand hervor, zwischen denen ich mich extrem schwertat, welche ich behalten sollte.Soundcore Liberty Pro 3 & Sony WF-1000XM4-----------------------------------------------Um die beiden Produkte auf Alltagstauglichkeit zu testen, habe ich sie ebenfalls auf der Arbeit bei Telefonkonferenzen getestet.Die Liberty Pro 3 und WF-1000XM4 lieferten bei Musik mit Abstand den besten Sound. Die Soundcore haben geben etwas mehr Volumen und Tiefen, aber bei den Sony gefiel mir das Gesamtklangbild besser. Die Auswahl an Stöpseln ist bei den Soundcore herausragend, 4 verschiedene Größen. Ebenfalls hebt sich Anker mit dem Klappcase und dem sliding-Mechanismus beim Ladecase ab. Sony setzt auf ein eher platzsparendes Design. Das Klangbild ist nahezu überragend, wobei man bei Kickdrums und auch bei Anrufen ein metallisches Klirren verzeichnet. Da die Soundcore den Klang insb. bei Sprache durch zu viel Tiefen unnatürlich erscheinen lassen, sind Sony für mich die Soundsieger. Der Sitz hat mir nach langem Überlegen auch bei Sony besser gefallen. Wenn bei Soundcore 4 verschiedene Stöpselgrößen dabei sind, bei denen ich kein einziges Mal ein 100% sicheres Tragegefühl hatte, bringt mir die große Variation auch nichts. Die Sony kann man ziemlich einfach in die Ohren reindrücken. Bei den Soundcore ist man auch auf die „Haltehilfen“ angewiesen, die ich in keinen sicheren Sitz bringen konnte. Das NC ist bei Sony überragend, bei Soundcore allerdings auch ziemlich gut.Man muss betonen, dass sie Soundcore als fast 60€ günstigeres Produkt extrem gut mit den Sony mithalten. Ich musste wirklich Tage überlegen, für welche ich mich entscheiden soll. Wer also das Geld sparen will, ist mit den Liberty 3 Pro bestens bedient. Aufgrund des herausragenden Sounds und Sitzes gehen die Sony WF-1000XM4 als knappe Sieger aus dem Test hervor. Dank Black-Friday war der Preis völlig erschwinglich. Die Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro betrachte ich als Preis-Leistungssieger.","Reviewed in Germany on 5 December 2022","Mein Preis-Leistungs-Verlierer, instabile Bluetooth Verbindung, schlechter Klang, viel zu klobig","2.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41+WgypdH3L.jpg

"RLN2756BI5HR3","Matthew Lal","The ANC was so incredible to experience, almost too good, if someone's breaking into the house I'll never know!But the rest sadly... SUCKS.With Airpods and Galaxy Buds the case is magnetic, it's so satisfying to open and close you find yourself doing it just to do it. The Bose case on the other hand is not magnetic but has a latch, a FLIMSY latch. The case feels like something you'd buy from the fleamarket, opening it is a pain as you have to really push the button in, even having to use my fingernails sometimes to press it all the way. It has no weight to it, it squeaks when you press on it like it's going to shatter. It is big yes, but I don't really mind the size, I mind its quality and design.. AWFUL case.The buds themselves are counterintuitive!!!!! In this day and age how could a company not only known for making audio products but being THE audio company make wireless earbuds that still require you to constantly take your phone out to navigate?!Galaxy Buds havea one press to play, 2 press to skip forward, and 3 press to skip backwards, with an app to change what a long press can do  Great, I don't need to take my phone out to change music.And if I want to listen to just the left bud (I'm in security so I have a 2-wire in the right ear) no problem I can listen with just the left, the single, double, and long presses will still work on just the oneBose on the other hand... double press to play on the RIGHT bud, long press on the RIGHT bud to activate voice assistant without the option of changing that (because I really need voice assistant right?)The Left bud has double press to change noise cancellation levels based on 3 settings you've set up (WHY? If anything it should be double press to alternate between full noise cancellation and zero nose cancellation) So if someone is talking to me I now have to keep double pressing the left bud till 0% noise cancellation pops up then keep at it again to go back to full ANC..... I look like an idiot doing this so I just take the buds out of my earsThe LEFT bud has a long press to skip forward, which you can change to instead tell you the battery level....... (Battery level is when you should be taking your phone out, save the gestures for ESSENTIAL hands free operations maybe?[this thinking is so backwards])Oh and you can't listen to the left bud alone. Rip me I guess, and if you're just listening to the right, well remember only the left can skip music so out comes the phone againThe eartip wings also hurt and get itchy, I've even gotten a scab from wearing these, and yes I've tried all sizes.IT BLOWS MY MIND a company that's a titan in the audio industry releases a near $300 earbud but decides to go with version 1.0 when the competition is on version 20, you should be improving upon your competitor's designs to make it the most intuitive earbud yet instead you're going backwards.If this was the first wireless earbud ever released all that^ would make sense, but it's not, so it doesn't. It's like Toyota releasing a new car with no disc brakes, no bluetooth, a cassette player, roll down windows, no safety features and then pricing it more than the new 2021 vehicles out there.....","Reviewed in the United States on 9 March 2021","ANC Blew my mind, everything else is why I'm returning it","2.0 out of 5 stars","","4","Triple Black"

Para mi no es el sonido que aprecio tanto de Bose.Cuando los pones sale un sonido agradable como una campana y después te indica el nivel de batería PERO no está al mismo nivel que el sonido que después vas a escuchar así que es una sorpresa porque puede ser más alto o más bajo y como NO SE PUEDE CONTROLAR EL SONIDO directamente en el auricular, pues es una sorpresa, digamos que después te llaman o haces un llamada o pones tu música pues te sale más alto o más bajo que lo que esperabas.Imagina que estás en casa los haz puesto a un nivel para salir a la calle y después cuando sales, claro con el ruido de la calle, resulta que  es demasiado bajo así que tienes que encontrar y sacar tu móvil para cambiar el nivel del sonido, todo esto en el momento que estamos viviendo donde hay que evitar tocar cosas y el móvil!Nivel bloqueo de sonido está más o menos bien, podría ser mejor de verdad.Para casi el doble de precio del modelo anterior a sido para mi una gran decepción que no están al nivel de funcionalidad de otras marcas donde hoy en día se controla todo a través del auricular.Los dos shortcuts también no sirven para nada que ya te anuncia el nivel de batería cuando se ponen.Espero solucionen este tema de control de sonido con un nuevo firmware, si no seguramente que los tendré que devolver aunque para la forma de mis orejas son los que se adaptan mejor ya que he probado otras marcas.","Reviewed in Spain on 6 November 2020","No se puede cambiar el volumen en el auricular solo en el móvil - gran decepción","2.0 out of 5 stars","","17","Triple Black"
"RZREDRQIDGWBC","Nick","I washed my Airpods Pro three days before my holiday. Disaster. I decided on trying Bose again after having owned a variety of QC products over the years, and favouring their earbud tips over any other that I've tried. My experience using these on holiday didn't go as I had hoped, and organised a return for the reasons below.Positives:- Great battery life in both the earbuds and case.- Nice design. A bit bigger than most, but they look nice, feel good quality, sit well within the case and generally do their bit in terms of looks.- Nice and snug fit, no falling out even when out for a run.- Good ANC. Bose have been leaders in this for a while now. It's nothing new, no real difference between Airpods.Negatives:- The case is huge. Probably twice the volume of the airpods pro case. It also has a manual clip that you need to press in to open. Just gets a bit annoying to have a large case with a cheap opening mechanism.- This will likely depend on the user, but I couldn't wear these for more than 3-4 hours at a time before relieving my ears of the pain. Having tried multiple tip sizes, it's simply the earbuds themselves that are uncomfortable.- Sound quality is.. just ok. Bose have a reputation for groundbreaking sound, and these aren't it. Much prefer the airpods here.- Touch control are poor. There's no way to turn ANC off.. and then on. You're limited to 3 (no less, no more) customisable options which is great, but 3 options means its impossible to code in an ANC on/off. For example, Option 1 is 100% ANC, Option 2 is 0%.... but then what do you do with Option 3? ANC 100%? Sadly not as the seqence is 1 2 3 1 2 3, so you're always going to have two 100% or two 0% options next to eachother. tl;dr  it is impossible to set an ANC on/off. As for the other controls, you can only pause (with a double right tap) and volume changes. Even these are a little iffy. Not at all intuitive.- Weird lagging and unsmooth transition between connecting via bluetooth and starting music.All in all, disappointing from Bose. Some things are user preference, but others just are simply design issues that make this a no go. Airpods Pro have something special, in all aspects. Bose have fallen way short.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 October 2021","Bought to replace Airpod Pros. Returned in favour of AirPods.","2.0 out of 5 stars","","18","Soapstone"
"R2O0EY39ZH4A0L","MR A COFFIN","These are, without doubt, fantastic sounding earbuds. I've had two sets of QC20's in the past which lasted me 6+ years combined so an upgrade to these QC TWS seemed like a no-brainer. I enjoy the sound profile of Bose in ears, despite them being a touch boomy and bass heavy (I listen to a wide variety of music, but I probably favour Drum & Bass, Techno, House, Hip-Hop and Reaggae the most)The pros:- Great sounding, out of the box. Even better with a little EQing- The app is solid, flexible and lots of fine tuning available.- The ANC is superb; I personally find it just has the edge over Sony's WF1000 XM4's which I am now using (more on that in a minute) and the level of custimisation of the strength of the ANC is also a bonus- I like the design; I appreciate the '1990's hands free phone headset' isn't for everyone.- They're light- They're easily the most comfortable in-ear buds I've usedCons:- Build quality, build quality, build quality! I've had 3 sets fail on my in the space of 18 months. For £200+ earbuds, this is totally unacceptable.- Minor irritation; that you can't walk away from the charging case, it HAS to be on your person taking up pocket/bag space.- Touch controls often require quite a hard tap to activate, I have sensitive ears so this irks me, as result, I usually just disable and don't use them.All in all, I just can't recommend these, 3 pairs failing within 12 months is just unacceptable.

"R1P85Z0Q58M78E","Amazon Customer","I've had these earbuds for 4 months now and did some considerable research prior to buying these trying to decide between the Sennheiser Momentum vs Apple Airpod Pro vs these. I have always been an avid Bose fan for their consistent delivery in sound quality and customer service which ultimately swayed me towards purchasing these. However, if you were thinking of paying £200+ at this point for these headphones, I'd hold out until they release their next generation as there are significant issues with these buds as follows:1. The user interface is not very intuitive. Feels outdated and 'old' in comparison to market rivals. Example, can only forward on to the next song and not replay or go back. The touch control is a bit hit and miss and not something I've bothered using. It's sometimes overly sensitive (Triggering voice control through the iphone) and sometimes doesn't respond at all!2. The sound quality without noise cancellation is mediocre and falls flat. Prior to these I owned the Cambridge Audio Melomanias and they sounded much better (without ANC).3. The noise cancellation isn't perfect. Possibly the Apple Airpod Pros offer an equally better/slightly better experience (for a lesser price!).4. Bluetooth pairing. You can only switch devices either with the case or the app so it requires you to carry your phone or case at all times. Even then, the app doesn't always work. Occasionally, the sound is not equal between the two buds (it favours either the left or right bud depending on volume) and the only way to fix it is to place it back in the case and re-pair it!Overall, if this was the only ANC bluetooth earbuds on the market, it would be worth the splurge. However, this isn't new technology and there are trendier looking, equally better, cheaper options. I don't think the price is justified and think it's only worth £150 or so (much of it for the Bose brand).","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 May 2021","Average.

"R2KRSHNOON1MFS","David","Bose, if you're charging this much for earbuds then look at your competition first. I am comparing these to my Apple AirPods Pro which is probably the biggest competitor in this segment and the Bose QC Earbuds are worse in almost every category while being $60 more expensive.The ANC is very good, but for $279 earbuds I also expect the best possible experience in usability, material quality and connectivity. And that's where they aren't any better than a cheap $40 pair of earbuds.The negative:- The charging case is clunky and the plastic inside feels cheap. The mechanical opening mechanism also feels cheap and it's difficult to open the case with one hand without lifting it up. Bose, for that price why didn't you go for a magnetic opening mechanism?- The Bluetooth range is pretty mediocre, it usually loses the signal in the next room already. As a comparison, my AirPods usually stay connected in the entire house.- The controls work but tapping the earbuds is uncomfortable in your ear. Imagine slapping on your ear with your flat hand, that's how it feels.- Transparency mode is okay but it's not as clear as the AirPods, and there's a constant white noise in the background.- Why can't I change the amount of ANC modes (""Favorites"")? You're stuck with 3 modes even though I only want to switch between full transparency and full ANC. There's always one mode in between so I need to tap 4 times to get full ANC.- It only connects to one device at a time. And switching devices is bothersome. (see next point)- What's the point of the ""Source"" view in the app? In order to connect to other devices I need to disconnect it from my phone, so the app loses connection, too, which makes the entire view obsolete.- The ""eartip wings"" are different from previous products (eg. the SoundTrue earbuds), and they don't fit as well anymore. It depends on your ear shape of course, but my old SoundTrue earbuds are muuuch more comfortable and stable.- The initial ""Connected to ..."" voice every time you put the earbuds in is obnoxious. If your device name is long (and you can't change it because it's a work computer!) it'll take like 5-10 seconds every time until you can hear things because the robot voice wants to read your full device name first.The positive:- Sound is ok. Not as clear as the AirPods Pro but okay. It's a bit more bass heavy than previous Bose products which I like.- ANC is very very good, better than the AirPods Pro.- Even though the earbuds are a bit chunkier they're still light and look pretty decent.Overall in my opinion these earbuds should be priced around $150 to $199 max. But for $279 the product is not refined enough.","Reviewed in the United States on 21 October 2020","Only ANC is top","2.0 out of 5 stars","","2","Soapstone"
"R1XMR0I64PO12R","Doctortee","Über Klang und Noise Canceling brauch ich fast nichts zu schreiben: es ist gut bis sehr gut, wie die meisten ja schon vor mir festgestellt haben. Wenn auch das Noise Canceling jetzt nicht wirklich alles wegblockt, was es so an Geräuschen gibt. Meine neben mir auf dem Sofa sitzende Partnerin kann ich sehr wohl noch verstehen, wenn sie mit mir spricht und ich dabei nur das NC aktiviert habe, aber keine Musik höre. Mit Musik höre ich sie aber tatsächlich dann nicht mehr.So, jetzt aber zum für mich Wichtigen:Ich suche schon länger Kopfhörer, die ich für alles  nutzen kann: Ruhe in Zug und Flugzeug, Musik und Hörbücher hören, und vor allem: überall telefonieren können. Das klappt zuhause gut, aber ich fahre auch viel Fahrrad, und da sind die Bose lausig: beim Radfahren, selbst recht langsam (zwischen 5 und 15 km/h) verstand mich meine Freundin kaum. Ich musste schon in Schrittgeschwindigkeit fahren, damit sie sich nicht beschwerte. Ich selbst verstand sie gut. Aber Hintergrundgeräusche werden ebenso an das Gegenüber übertragen. Auch das fiel ihr auf und sie sagte, dass wir das Gespräch doch vielleicht besser in ruhiger Umgebung weiterführen sollten. Es waren normale Stadtgeräusche... Das Maß aller Dinge ist hier nach wie vor das Plantronic Headset 5200 UC: die Dinger filtern wirklich alles raus. Selbst bei 30 km/h auf dem Rad beschwert sich niemand am anderen Ende über Windgeräusche oder vorbeifahrende Autos (da gibt es eher das Problem, dass ich niemanden mehr verstehe, weil die Plantronics nur locker auf dem Ohr sitzen und ich selbst Wind- und andere Geräusche sehr stark höre). Und das führt auch schon zum zweiten Punkt: das Hören beim Telefonieren, überhaupt das Hören von Musik oder Hörbüchern klappt auch nur bei sehr langsamer Geschwindigkeit, denn die Windgeräusche überdecken schnell alles. Diese Kopfhörer kann man nicht beim Radfahren benutzen! Bei 20 km/h verstehe ich Hörbücher nicht mehr, und Musikhören macht keinen Spaß mehr. Von vernünftigen Telefonieren ganz zu Schweigen. Ich denke mal, für Leute an der Küste wird das wohl ähnlich sein...Bei mir kommt noch das grundsätzliche Problem dazu, dass ich die Hörer recht fest in die Position reindrehen muss, damit sie gut halten. Ich schaffe es zwar, dass sie dann tatsächlich halten, um kein einziges Mal bei einer 13 km langen Fahrstrecke auf dem Rad neu positionieren oder erneut fest ins Ohr drücken zu müssen, aber ich merke den Sitz sehr und ich bin froh, nach einer Tragezeit von 60min die Bose aus den Ohren nehmen zu können. Ich habe alle drei Aufsätze probiert...Also, bei mir passen sie nicht optimal, und wenn, dann tun sie mir in den Ohren weh nach relativ kurzer Zeit. Und bevor jemand auf die Idee kommt, dass das der Grund für die Windgeräusche und damit verbundene schlechte Hörbarkeit ist: die Teile sitzen und dichten gut ab und ich merke auf jeden Fall den Unterschied zwischen 'locker sitzen' und 'dicht sitzen' - daran liegt es nicht. Es ist wahrscheinlich die aus den Ohren herausragende Position und dass noch kein Hersteller auf die Idee gekommen ist, In-Ears so zu designen, dass der Wind um die Mikrofone herumgeleitet wird  und nicht direkt darüber.

"R3ULO5P0GA8PLK","Amazon Customer","Owned these for 2 days before returning them after an apparent firmware failure.Pro:-Amazing sound.-Amazing noise canceling.-Seemed to fit mostly securely.Mixed:-I had to put a larger eartip size in just one ear. My ears are slightly different, but i've never had to do this before. Not necessarily a negative.-The charging case is huge. I'm mixed because I destroyed my galaxy buds by accidentally washing them inside their charging case in my gym shorts pocket. There's no way i'm accidentally missing this giant case, but it is a little unwieldly.-The charging case opens with an awkward push button instead of magnets. I could potentially get used to it over time, but this push button felt really awkward and took multiple tries to open every time. However, on my old bluetooth ear buds the charging case magnetically closed. On the occasion i've accidentally dropped that case, as soon as it hits the ground the case would pop open and send both ear buds literally flying out of the case. The button on these prevents that.Con:-Would no longer connect to bluetooth after the 1st day. The buds both showed red/white alternating flashing lights that multiple answers on Google say is a firmware error. Could potentially fix it with a couple hours of troubleshooting, but it's not my job to fix Bose's lemons. It also doesn't make me feel confident in a $300 investment.-Could not connect to bluetooth without the buds being in the case even after they were paired. My current cheap $40 ear buds will pair automatically with my phone on opening the case and being put in my ears. Allegedly a phone app could remedy this, but that just seems like extra steps that none of my previous bluetooth earbuds needed.-One ear bud never seemed to sit quite right and physically felt odd. My two ears are slightly different, but i've never had an issue like that. Maybe i'd get used to it over time.-These protrude quite a bit from your ears. I like to listen to soundscapes while I fall asleep and specifically wanted these because my over-the-head earphones are somewhat uncomfortable for side sleepers. These were actually worse to side sleep with because of how much they protrude from your ear.Altogether I was disappointed. My Bose over-the-head earphones are great. These ear buds were a dud. I also tried the Bose soundsport ear buds awhile back. After 1 day at the gym they were returned from having them nonstop disconnect & reconnect anytime I moved. It was absolutely aggravating. 1 for 3 on some pretty expensive Bose products.","Reviewed in the United States on 4 April 2021","Software failure on the 2nd day","2.0 out of 5 stars","","3","Triple Black"
"R1PQAMMT3XBVVN","Vlora (Reviews and Cake)","Da ich mehr Bahn fahre als in den vergangenen Jahren, habe ich beschlossen, in teure Kopfhörer zu investieren. Ich hatte noch nie Bluetooth Kopfhörer und hatte deshalb etwas Angst, dass ich sie sofort verliere. Ich habe die Kopfhörer nun seit ein paar Wochen und ich finde, man muss beim Tragen schon vorsichtig sein, es ist aber nicht so schlimm, wie ich es mir vorgestellt habe. Einmal bin ich ausversehen mit der Hand dumm drangekommen, so dass einer der Kopfhörer auf dem Bahnsteig rausgeflogen und paar Meter weiter gelandet ist, was nicht so toll war, ansonsten hatte ich aber noch keine Probleme damit. In der Tasche gehen sie aufgrund des großen Cases nicht so schnell verloren. Die Akkulaufzeit reicht für mich für den Alltag gut. Das noise cancelling ist Spitzenklasse und für mich jeden Euro wert. Laute Geräusche werden gut unterdrückt, so dass die Fahrt in der Bahn oder der Gang durch den vollen Supermarkt auf einmal deutlich entspannter ist. Der eigentlich Sound ist auch gut. Von mir eine Kaufempfehlung!Edit: Kopfhörer gingen leider nach weniger als einem Jahr kaputt. Ein Kopfhörer funktionierte einfach nicht mehr. Liebe sie, musste sie jetzt aber einschicken, auf der Bose Website steht, dass ich innerhalb von vier Wochen Ersatz bekomme, das heißt ich muss jetzt mehrere Wochen ohne meine Kopfhörer verbringen. Das enttäuscht doch sehr bei diesem hohen Preis nach so kurzer Zeit. Sehr schade. Update2: Zwei Wochen nach Einschicken der Kopfhörer habe ich noch nichtmal ein Update bekommen, ob sie da sind und wie es weitergeht. Nur weil ich nochmal den customer service via whatsapp kontaktiert habe (Antworten brauchen mehrere Stunden), habe ich überhaupt herausfinden können, dass sie irgendwo in Belgien, wo sie anscheinend hin sollten, angekommen sind. Es ist echt ärgerlich. Bin gespannt ob bzw. wann ich jetzt eine Bestätigung und Ersatz bekomme.Update: Habe nach drei Wochen Ersatz für meine kaputten Kopfhörer bekommen. In dieser ganzen Zeit aber keine einzige Nachricht von bose, ob die alten Kopfhörer angekommen sind, wann die neuen ankommen etc., bis die neuen abgesendet wurden. Ich habe nun das neuere Modell bekommen. Es stört mich nicht, dass es etwas anders aussieht/sitzt, allerdings funktioniert das noise cancelling, das Hauptargument für diese Kopfhörer, gefühlt leider nicht so gut, wie bei den alten. Sachen, die ich mit den alten im Prinzip gar nicht gehört habe, wie Bahnansagen, höre ich jetzt trotzdem. Bisschen enttäuschend, aber bin froh, dass es mit dem Ersatz geklappt hat, auch wenn es lange gedauert hat und die Kommunikation nicht gut war.","Reviewed in Germany on 17 April 2022","Leben wird stressfreier, aber schnell kaputt","2.0 out of 5 stars","","2","Soapstone"
"R2AJQFQXB9QSLK","Bud","I hate to give one-star reviews.  I never do.  I wanted to give 3 at least, because the audio quality is good.  I'm only not giving it a one-star for that.  If they don't refund me, I will move this to a 1 star.I've had these phones for a couple months.  Before I get to my main gripe, I will quickly mention that people can't hear me anymore on bluetooth calls, and I'm getting a LOT of static all of the sudden (not bluetooth related, disconnect and it's still there).Here's the problem with these headphones.  The touch controls.  There are no buttons, and the touch controls are very sensitive.  So if you are a guy with medium length hair like me, who works out very hard and sweats A LOT, either the hair bouncing on the right earbud or the sweat causes it to constantly activate Siri on your iPhone, or pause the music.  The left earbud has a shortcut function that can be turned off, so that helps (because otherwise the left touch control would activate constantly as well).  I was hoping after a few firmware updates, they would have given the option to turn off touch functionality on the right earbud -- after all, these are designed for fitness, and I can't be the only one out there with medium length hair that sweats a lot.  And for the price of these headphones.... the fact that they haven't addressed this is really sad.If you don't sweat a lot, or just don't really work out that hard, then you may find that these earbuds work well for you.  But I had to go back to my Jaybird Vistas because they had a button and wouldn't constantly shut off the music once i get halfway through an intense metabolic conditioning workout or 15 minutes of running.I have a workout Instagram account, @lift.hacks, that I was posting workouts to during quarantine that you can check out to see if this will apply to you.  If you're curious about getting these headphones, and wonder if my problems will apply to you, check out the page.... if your hair is anything like mine, and you sweat like that, then avoid these headphones at all costs.","Reviewed in the United States on 29 July 2021","Touch Controls Make Intense Workouts and Running Imposisble with Sweat and Long Hair","2.0 out of 5 stars","","2","Triple Black"
"R29DH1KCQLDM6L","DianaKL","I confidently ordered these bluetooth noise cancelling earbuds because I had purchased Bose products before and was very satisfied. Now I have to rethink that confidence. I ordered them in Dec 2021 because I knew I had travel coming up this year; however, because of a variety of circumstances, I wasn't able to actually get them set up for use until May 2022. I've had nothing but trouble with them ever since. The bluetooth only intermittently connects with my phones. I do not have this problem with other bluetooth devices. Once I got them fully charged and working for a four hour flight, they crapped out after about 3 hours. Not enough service for the international flights I take, so I purchased a cheaper set of bluetooth earbuds as backup (though they are not noise cancelling). I brought the Bose earbuds on a recent flight, thinking I had solved the problems. They seemed to work okay on the transAtlantic flight going, but while in Europe the right side earbud stopped charging. So now they don't work at all. I looked for help online and found the videos on Amazon. But the videos are video only, no audio, so they are difficult/impossible to understand clearly and the earbuds featured in them are different from the model I have, so I'm not confident in their advice anyway. I also went to the Bose website, and still didn't find the help I needed. My only choice may be to call their help line and waste a bunch more time on a product that could have worked from the beginning. And that I've only had the chance to use twice.I spent $200 thinking I would get Bose quality (and now I see the price is $250 today!), but I am very unhappy with these. I even bought the separate case to keep them safe, and now none of it was worth what I spent.

"R1S1BTV6FO71YY","BB","I first tried Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro, but was disappointed in the quality of sound that my client's were hearing.  Round two, I decided to spend the money on Bose because I've always trusted their quality, and I really needed good sound for clients.  Unfortunately these have been a great disappointment, so much that I'm returning them.  Not sure if I got a bad pair or what, but I had too many clients tell me they had a hard time hearing me or that my voice sounded muffled.  I also had the Bluetooth drop connection in the middle of the call.  The other issue I have with them is the connectivity is super slow.  I was use to Apple airpods that connect almost immediately, but these take much longer.  This may have been user error or a setting issue, but I don't leave them in my ear all the time.  I leave them in the case till a call comes in.  Problem I had is the delay from when you put them in the ear and when you hear audio.  Not only does it take a while, but there's also a second or two where you can't hear the audio on the phone nor earbuds while it connects.  Other connectivity issue is because of the delayed connections, when you hit to answer the phone on the phone while waiting for the earbud to connect, once the BT connects, you have to then reselect the bose as the audio source you want to use.  The Apple airbuds automatically connect once they connect, and they connect in less than half the time.  I would have lived with the connectivity issues had the phone quality for my clients been better, but that wasn't an option with this pair.  I like Bose, so I'm hoping it was a bad pair but not willing to gamble and buy another, especially with the 20% restocking fee.","Reviewed in the United States on 15 July 2022","Audio quality is great, but phone calls have issues, and connectivity leaves much to be desired.","2.0 out of 5 stars","","2","Soapstone"
"R2HTZEOQZ43E1Q","Waldo Ricky","This was a replacement set, the first having been returned the day after it was delivered.  Once again, the left earbud had no power, would not charge.  I spoke to a Bose Corp. person, arranged for a replacement, will ship the defective pair back today.  Wish they would work.  A QC issue with the earbud battery?  Twice on two occasions has to be more than coincidental. Ironically this replaces a set that I lost which worked fine.  It seems to me that the problem is quality control at Bose, not Amazon.Update Sept 2 2022:  The returned earbuds were recieved at the Bose return site on Aug 30th.  The email said it could take up to 5 days to review the device and issue a replacement (in contrast to the 3-5 business days I was told about on Aug 23rd). So I called Bose, was told there had been no movement on the replacement, but she was able to issue a replacement, which I hope to receive next week.Update Sept 06, 2022.  I did indeed receive the Bose QC earbuds from Bose itself.  They worked fine, iop[paired with bluetooth.

"R2OK3ZJRCT44XM","Benjamin J. Parrish","I bought these to complement my QC35 headphones, for when I do something active (e.g. yard work) and I do not want the cord of my QC20i's getting in the way.  My first impression was ""meh"".  You need the case to pair them to a device, and the controls are all virtual (e.g. touch, tap, etc).  That seems to par for course for bluetooth earbuds so I overlooked that.The second impression was worse.  I paired the earbuds to my phone (an older model Samsung Galaxy S5), and carried the phone in my pocket.  The sound kept skipping and cutting out.  Sometimes it would be the left ear.  Sometimes the right ear.  Sometimes both ears.  It happened every few seconds, and got to the point where it was frustrating to listen to.  I figured ""ok, maybe it is the earbuds"".  I switched to my QC35s.  The same thing happened, to a lesser degree.  So I figured it was the phone and got a dedicated bluetooth MP3 player (a Surfans F20).  The ear buds continued to have issues.So I said ""ok, maybe it is a Bose issue afterall"".  I bought some $30 bluetooth earbuds.  Two different brands.  Both maintained a steady connection to the MP3 player.So long story short, a pair of generic $30 earbuds can outperform these $300 earbuds.  Maybe not in sound quality, or noise cancellation.  Bose wins there.  But none of that matters IF THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION IS NOT STABLE AND THE MUSIC KEEPS CUTTING OUT.I am inclined to think the Bose bluetooth hardware has a horrible antennae, and only works in best-case scenarios.  For example, the QC35s work great with my Samsung TV (though pairing them can be a pain).  Maybe my expectation of being able to carry a bluetooth media player in my pocket is unreasonable.  Not sure.  It does make these earbuds expensive paperweights, though.Be sure and try before you buy.","Reviewed in the United States on 25 August 2021","Bluetooth connection is horrible","2.0 out of 5 stars","","4","Triple Black"
"RT8WM0GQ5JBVH","Very Important Businessman","I have had these phones for a few months and the one thing I noticed with them is that there is consistent problems connecting to my phone via Bluetooth. I would say they connect to my phone and work properly on the first attempt about 20% of the times I use them. Unacceptable!I open the case, wait for the blue lights to flash, then insert them into the ears. I hear the ""Battery 100%, connected to iPhone"", but then that's it. Once I attempt to play music, nothing. It doesn't matter the music app (Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, etc.), the app shows the music playing, but I don't hear anything. Volume is up and everything. The workaround is to put them back into the case, close the case, wait about 10 seconds, open up the case again, wait for the blue lights, insert them into ears. Usually the 2nd time works, but seriously, for the amount of money for these things, they should work PERFECTLY EVERY TIME!! Bose are supposed to be some the best audio products out there, but these buds are a complete letdown.None of the other features mean a thing (battery life, sound cancelling, etc.) if the buds don't ACTUALLY PLAY MUSIC! I have had no problems with battery life or sound cancelling when they do work. They sound great and are very comfortable in the ears. I don't really understand the point of the Bose app as it doesn't really offer anything worth opening a separate app for.When they work, they're great. But the Bluetooth connectivity issue is a huge disappointment from a company I thought was the best in the biz.

"RMLHMELP06DVK","Julia","Ich hatte diese Buds 2x bestellt:Das erste Mal war ich genervt darüber, wie schlecht die Integration mit Siri funktioniert hat. Nicht nur war Siri schmerzhaft laut (kann man tatsächlich einstellen, musste ich aber erst ergoogeln) sondern meine Sprachbefehle und diktierter Text wurden nur sehr schlecht erkannt. Das Problem habe ich auch mit den Bose QuietControl 30 und Bose QuietComfort 35. Und es nervt. Darüber hinaus ist das Wechseln zwischen Geräten (Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Nintendo Switch) nur möglich wenn man das Ladecase zur Hand hat – also immer danach suchen um umzuschalten. Ganz zu schweigen davon, dass man zur Bedienung auf die Buds tappen muss, was sich im Ohr sehr unangenehm anfühlt. Und die Benutzung von nur einem Earbud ist nicht möglich (wenn der andere in der Ladeschale ist); zumindest führte das bei mir dazu, dass die Umgebung sich kurz meinen Podcast/meine Musik mit anhören musste. Also wieder zurück geschickt in der Annahme, dass andere Hersteller ja inzwischen beim NC (was mein Hauptfokus ist) aufgeholt haben müssten.Bis auf die akuellen Sony MX4 habe ich alle probiert und wäre am liebsten bei den Apple AirPods Pro geblieben weil die von der Bedienung am besten waren – ich hätte mich sogar mit dem nicht-so-tollen NC abgefunden, aber leider schmerzen mir bei den AirPods Pro die Ohren nach nur wenigen Minuten. Das, und die Tatsache das sie beim NC vielleicht gerade mal 60% so viel Lärm wegfiltern wie die Bose, lies sie wieder zurück gehen und ich wollte den Bose noch eine Chance geben.Also noch mal Bose bestellt – und diesmal ging der linke Kopfhörer innerhalb von 5 Minuten nicht mehr. Eine fixe Suche nach einer Lösung förderte zu Tage, dass dies scheinbar ein konstantes Problem mit diesem Produkt ist. Unglaublich, dass man für 200 Euro etwas verkauft was scheinbar einen serienmäßigen Fehler hat. Da ist es egal, dass Bose das beste NC auf dem Markt hat – wenn nur 1 Earbud geht höre ich ja trotzdem um mich herum alles.Die 2 Sterne gibt es für das absolut exzellente NC, aber die Usability der Kopfhörer und Zuverlässigkeit (dass sie überhaupt funktionieren) ist unterirdisch. Scheinbar muss ich mir jetzt nach 15 Jahren tatsächlich eine andere Firma suchen, denen ich meine Ohren anvertraue.

"RYNVEDX19ET4X","Basti","An sich kann ich mich nur allen Reviews die man auf Youtube findet anschließen: Die Bose QC Earbuds haben klasse Sound und das ANC ist definitiv auf einem Level mit den Bose Quietcomfort 35 II, ABER es gibt keine Möglichkeit das ANC zu deaktivieren oder in einen Wind Modus zu schalten. Die QC 35 II haben extra eine Stufe für viel Wind, damit kann ich Fahrrad fahren und höre kein lästiges Rauschen oder ähnliches. Demnach ist das Know-How bei Bose ja definitiv vorhanden.Als jemand der in Norddeutschland wohnt und viel Fahrrad fährt ist das für mich ein absolutes No-Go und auch der Grund dafür, warum ich die Earbuds zurück schicke. Ich habe auch bereits im Bose Forum gelesen, dass mehrere Leute das Problem hatten, die Tips die dort geäußert wurden (Lautstärke der eigenen Stimme ändern) und auch das ausprobieren jeder einzelnen ANC Stufe hat nicht geholfen. Wenn ich Rad fahre und dann im Zweifel auch noch Gegenwind habe ist es vorbei und die Mikrofone geben den Wind den Sie aufnehmen direkt aus und ich kann mir das Musik hören gänzlich sparen.Das ist finde ich ein Armutszeugnis für Bose, denn1. Steht Bose für hochwertige Produkte und beste Qualität2. Ist das Enigneering und das Know-How zum lösen dieses Problems ja vorhanden, die QC 35 II kriegen es ja hin und so weit ich weiß wurde das selbe Problem bei den 700 auch nachträglich mit einem Firmware Update gelöstIch will aber nicht so viel Geld ausgeben für ein nicht fertig engineertes Produkt, bei dem Preis erwarte ich eine fertige und voll funktionsfähige Lösung.Schade eigentlich, jetzt werden es für mich doch die Airpods Pro, obwohl Apple für mich eigentlich nicht für guten Sound steht. Aber dort lässt sich das ANC deaktivieren und selbst mit eingeschaltetem ANC ist das Rauschen nicht ansatzweise so schlimm wie mit Bose.Ich kann abschließend nur noch einmal betonen, dass ich es echt Schade finde die Bose Earbuds zurück zu schicken. Ich hatte mich sehr auf das Produkt gefreut und bin mit einer positiven Haltung gegenüber Bose an die Sache herangegangen und wurde leider enttäuscht, was eigentlich echt schwer ist, wenn ich einer Marke/einem Produkt gegenüber schon vor dem Erhalt positiv gestimmt bin.Vielleicht kommt ja noch das Entscheidende Firmware update oder das Nachfolgemodell bringt die Funktion mit sich, aber so werden wir keine Freunde.

So I was keen on replacing my old QuietComfort 20 headphones with the newest wireless version.When I received my first pair of the QuietComfort Earbuds, everything went fairly well. They are packaged nicely, the product design is very streamlined and what you'd expect from Bose. However, the case is unfortunately a bit difficult to open - you have to press the button a lot harder than it seems like you should need to. And, more importantly, the noise canceling isn't quite as good as the old wired version.Also, 2 days into using my new headphones... the left earbud stopped working and would no longer even charge in the case. I tried all of the various reset steps I could find online, and absolutely nothing worked. So I broken down and asked for a replacement pair from Amazon.The new pair arrived quickly and in good state. But when opening these up, I immediately found that the right earbud didn't work. Similar problem to the first pair, it wouldn't charge in the case, and wouldn't connect in any way with my device(s).Of course, I did my best to see if I could somehow mix the working right one from the first pair and the left one from the second pair... but didn't have any luck doing that.Anyway, eventually I decided that the tech just isn't up to par with the Bose standard yet, and ultimately returned them back to Amazon.

Deshalb tut es mir leid, für die Bose QuietComfort Earbuds eine so ernüchternde Bewertung abgeben zu müssen, da ich mich wirklich sehr drauf gefreut hatte, neue Lieblings-Kopfhörer zu erhalten.Positiv zu bewerten sind wieder einmal die Geräuschunterdrückung sowie der satte Klang, hier ist Bose einfach Marktführer. Leider war es das auch schon mit den positiven Punkten, denn mit dem restlichen Zubehör hatte ich einfach nur zu kämpfen. Es beginnt bereits beim Einsetzen der Earbuds, das in meinem Fall einfach mit keinem der drei mitgelieferten Aufsätze gut geklappt hat- keiner der Einsätze hat zufriedenstellenden Halt bieten können. Ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, dass die Earbuds bei mehr Bewegung lange im Ohr gehalten hätten, und ich habe wirklich sämtliche Einstellungen und Positionen durchprobiert. Aber wenn ich jedes Mal ewig herumfummeln muss, um guten Sound genießen zu können, nervt das einfach nur.Als sehr störend habe ich es empfunden, dass die Musik stoppt, sobald man einen Ohrhörer entfernt. Wenn man den in-ear beispielsweise lediglich besser positionieren möchte, stoppt bereits die Musik, und wozu das gut sein soll, erschließt sich mir nicht.Touchfunktion: Furchtbar. Bei falschem Antippen wird nicht die Lautstärke verändert oder die Musik gestoppt, sondern die Sprachsteuerung aktiviert und im schlimmsten Fall jemand random angerufen, wenn man nicht schnell genug das Smartphone in die Hand bekommt. Dies hat mir zwei sehr peinliche Momente beschert.Optisch sind die earbuds ok, wenn auch für Frauenohren eher wuchtig.Somit stand auf der Pro-Seite lediglich die gute Geräuschunterdrückung und das tolle Sounderlebnis.

"R2LHJA98KVAXK5","Evgeny","Hatte die Kopfhörer jetzt 2 Jahre lang.Gutes zuerst: Der Klang ist sehr gut. Das Noise Cancelling ist auch super. Der Akku ist hervorragend.Jetzt das Schlechte: Die Kopfhörer haben durchgehend Probleme gemacht. Das waren häufig Kleinigkeiten, z.B. haben sie sich manchmal einfach nicht mit dem Handy verbunden, obwohl sie schon gekoppelt waren. Für ein 200€-Produkt fand ich es aber unglaublich nervig, mich wöchentlich ganze U-Bahnfahrten lang mit den Kopfhörern rumschlagen zu müssen.Negativ ist auch, dass es keinen Transparenz-Modus gibt. Die entsprechende Option schaltet einfach nur Noise-Cancelling aus, man hört immernoch recht wenig, weil man eben Kopfhörer in den Ohren hat.Seit einer Woche spielt der linke Kopfhörer keinen Ton mehr. Er funktioniert noch, beispielsweise das Noise-Cancelling und die Touch-Steuerung, aber eben kein Ton. Es handelt sich also um einen Software-Fehler. Die Webseite von Bose ist absolut keine Hilfe. Die Vorschläge helfen nicht und sind nur schlecht übersetzt. Ich sehe auch keine Möglichkeit, die Kopfhörer reparieren zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich schade, denn ich habe nun ein Produkt, das an sich noch funktioniert, aber durch einen Software-Fehler kaum benutzbar ist. Für 200€ ist das eine Frechheit und eine viel zu kurze Lebensdauer.

"R2DPO7650Q6C2B","Amazon Kunde","Ich muss vorweg sagen, dass ich jahrelang mit Kabel IEM's Musik gehört habe, aber einfach was portables brauchte. Also hab ich zu den Bose Quietcomfort gegriffen, da diese generell recht gut bewertet und gerade im Sale waren. Nachdem ich verzweifelt über ne Stunde hinweg und 2 Neuinstallationen endlich die Kopfhörer Verbinden konnte, gab es doch eher Ernüchterung über den Klang. Währen die Driver an sich gut sind und ein schönes Klangbild haben, leidet der Kopfhörer unter dem Klassiker der Bluetooth Kopfhörer: schlechter Audiocodec. Verwendet wird hier AAC, der unter anderem auch bei Geräten mit Apfel verwendet wird, was allerdings bedeutet, dass Musik in den allermeisten Fällen gerade einmal mit knappen ø 260 kbps wiedergegeben wird.Zum Vergleich ist der Standard für MP3 Dateien sowie nicht Hi-Fi streams wie z.B. Spotify 320 kbps. Bedeutet im Endeffekt: der Driver von den Bose Kopfhörern kann noch so gut sein, wenn die Quelle wegen des Codecs einfach Qualitativ miese Musik abliefert...und das merkt man schon wenn man im Vergleich ein Paar 20€ Kabelkopfhörer verwendet.Klar für den Normalverbraucher, der mal nur nebenbei Musik hört is das vlt okay, aber für Leute die gerne und viel Musik hören und das in guter Qualität wird leider hier nicht fündig. Dass es auch anders geht zeigen andere Hersteller die Beispielsweise das LADC codec verwenden, dass sogar bis zu 900 kbps wiedergeben kann, oder das erst kürzlicht entwickelte AptX Lossless, das zwar noch keine große Untersützung hat, aber Musik hören in CD Qualität ermöglicht. Und für 150€ (im sale) unter dem MP3 Standard zu liegen ist für Bose fast schon peinlich.","Reviewed in Germany on 26 July 2022","Gute In-Ears aber schlechte Software","2.0 out of 5 stars","","2","Soapstone"
"R5PHNSJ8WP354","Ceyhun","First the good stuff:Product is (or used to be) great. Noise cancellation is pretty superb, sound quality great; works very well in calls and such. The october firmware update destroyed the experience on the top of the line macbook models however. The bluetooth connection regularly drops and the audio will have breaks (have tried two pairs of the buds so far with the new firmware)Also Kudos to AMAZON here! They came through for me where Bose was trying to rip me off, basically.Now the bad stuff:Can't say good things about Bose the company. After about 3 months one day I walked five minutes with the buds in my pocket after a run, and when I got back the smart assistant function was being triggered in a loop which made the product basically unusable, after a few factory resets this improved a bit but not anywhere near a functional state. Contacted amazon which initiated the warranty process for me and instructed me to email over my information to the warranty address for Bose, got no response from Bose. Contacted amazon again and they made me whole.The left earbud of the second pair Amazon sent didn't work so they replaced it one more time. Third time is the charm I guess, the third one works now except for the audio cutting out, connection dropping issue in MacBooks after the firmware update.If you are considering getting this product just adjust all the settings in the bose app the first time, then uninstall the app and make sure you don't get the firmware update, you don't need the Bose app for the product to work only to name it and adjust some settings.","Reviewed in the United States on 29 November 2021","Used to be a good product...","2.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Soapstone"
"R2D7QGCV5E24K3","crisfcar","As with any Bose product, you can expect great sound and excellent noise cancelling. Unfortunately, I bought this as my new sports earphones, and the cons are more than the pros. I had read reviews that talked about how clumsily they fit in your ears (true, although some practice getting them on is necessary) and how they tended to fall. I have had them for almost three months (too late to return them, unfortunately) I have to say I can't stand them anymore. I love them if I'm walking the dogs or cleaning up the house, but at the gym they are terrible. If you are running or powerwalking on the treadmill, they will be constantly getting out of place, and you have to keep putting them in your ear. That wouldn't be that bad if the right earbud didn't connect to siri or alexa and the left one didn't change settings all the time, all while pausing whatever you're listening to or watching on your phone. It makes you grumpy. Of course, I haven't tested this while running on the road (although you can test them by simply jumping in place, and they suck then as well). Clearly, as well, with so much slippage the noise cancelling doesn't work too well after a while. Also of importance, if you're lifting and holding your breath at the same time, or pushing a little harder, then the pressure in your head, or the movement of the muscles on your face and ears will also pop out the earphones. At the price I paid, I'm incredibly disappointed. I did try the smaller sized earpiece and that was even worse...Overall, I would not recommend, and if I had any chance of returning them still, I would in a heartbeat.","Reviewed in the United States on 30 September 2021","Not for Sports","2.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Triple Black"
"R2A8YD4C5I4LB6","WB","I invested almost eur200 in this product, attracted by the brand and technical characteristics after two of my Samsung Galaxy Buds had to be sent for repairs one after the other (ome was repaired after a month, the other was not repairable and retailer gave me a voucher for full value). This information is relevant because I could not help but make comparisons between these.Back to this piece of equipment, it looked good on the screen so I duly ordered, helped by the fact that it could be paid by monthly interest-free instalments.When it arrived, the first thing that caught my eye was the size of them, both the charging station and the earbuds were big, the former isnt great to carry around as it barely fits into any pocket and the latter look bulky in one's ears.Bluetooth connection: intuitively, I connected then to my phone straightaway which went fine but then it turned out one has to download the Bose Music app to finish the setup. I did that but the app would not connect to the phone and would not recognise the buds. I fiddled around until I ""uncoupled"" the bids from bluetooth, repeated the process and then it worked. The functionality of the buds themselves is very limited, by touching them one can only pause the song, change volume and separately program the left earbud to jump to next song (no rewind function). Samsung compares more favourably here as they have more functionality.Noise cancelling function in itself was good and suppressed noise well but when I switched it off, another background sound appeared like a constant hum which shouldnt be there so far as I am concerned, the earbuds should just go completely silent. Besides, after only 2-3minutes listening to songs at normal volume, it left me with blocked ears (as if descending in an aircraft) and a funny dizzy sensation in my head. This ust be the effect of whatever frequencies the noise cancelling uses and shouldnt be happening and is worrying.Overall I am sending them back and will look at other brands.","Reviewed in Germany on 20 January 2021","It goes back","2.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Triple Black"

Sauberer und klarer Klang, nicht zu starke, aber tolle Bässe.Einfach eine Wonne. Wurde hier aber schon zur Genüge beschrieben.Jetzt zum Grund, warum ich sie direkt wieder zurückschicke:Direkt beim Herausnehmen des rechten Earbuds hat mein Telefon per Sprachsteuerung irgendjemand aus der Kontaktliste angerufen. Ich habe mir erst nichts dabei gedacht. Habe in der App die Sprachsteuerung abgeschaltet. Als es zum 3. Mal passierte, achtete ich genauer darauf. Sobald man den rechten Earbud an der falschen Stelle berührt, startet die Sprachsteuerung, die Musik wird gestoppt und meist irgendjemand aus der Kontaktliste angerufen. Auch wenn man die neue Funktion laut/leise mit dem Streichen über die Touchfläche des rechten Earbuds nutzen will, passiert das ständig. Oft funktioniert die Lautstärkeregelung nicht oder nicht gut. Super nervig.In der Bose-Community wird dieser Fehler von vielen Nutzern über mehrere Seiten beschrieben, aber zum Unmut der Käufer gibt Bose vor, keine Lösung dafür parat zu habe. Sehr blamabel für eine Firma wie Bose.Ausschalten in der App sollte auch das Ausschalten bewirken. Jeder Nutzer sollte selber entscheiden dürfen, ob er dieses Feature nutzen möchte. Ich will es nicht. Das trübt massiv den Gesamteindruck der wertigen Earbuds und machen sie für mich zu einem unbrauchbaren Kopfhörer.

"R32I9JM1C43P1X","Nicky","Update, reduced to two stars. Ears are still painful 24 hours later. Returned them back to Amazon. Not sure what Bose is doing but this was extremely disappointing after owning two wired headphones and expecting the same quality and comfort for......So I went over the all the review before I spent this ungodly amount on these ear buds. I decided to take a chance on them. As the previous owner of wired Bose QC earbuds that I used with my android, they were the BEST!!! When I switched to Apple at the end of last year, my wired earbuds popped, the quick buttons didn't work, and I got frustrated. I bought the Apple Air Pod Pro and I own an Apple 11 Pro. Since I work from home, I was tired of only having one ear bud in all day long, switching when the battery ran low, and no back up so that is why I decided to look at these earbuds. I can say that with the wired Bose QC I was able to wear the medium sized ear tip but with this one I wear the small but they fit very well. The Bose sound is still amazing. The reason I gave it a 3 star is because of connectivity issues. I downloaded the Bose app and initially the earbuds connected to the phone through the app so the touch features worked really well. However it does not maintain the connection and is very difficult to connect through the app a second time. My earbuds connect to my phone with no trouble at all but because the app and the earbuds cannot pair together, none of the cool touch features work which is very disappointing. I have walked through the onscreen directions, unpaired them from my phone and tried to repair them through the app but for whatever reason, it will NOT connect to the app again. This also means you cannot use the QC technology either. Extremely disappointing!!!!","Reviewed in the United States on 28 January 2021","Own an Apple?

"RMW6LZHT0SZBO","Michael Caven","Pros:When properly seated in the ear, don't get me wrong, great sound quality as expected.Seems to fit great in reasonably sized ear canals (anything above super small).Pretty good noise cancellation, and I was really satisfied with how much customization you get through the app.Cons:One of my ear canals is super small, so even with the smallest ear piece, there was just no way this side-heavy lunk of an earbud was staying in there for more than about 15 minutes, unless I (TMI warning) thoroughly dried all oils and remnant earwax from the ear piece and my outer ear canal (/TMI), after which it would maybe stay in for an hour on a good day.When resituating an earbud into the ear canal, it makes that awful high pitched squeal that you sometimes hear when someone adjusts a hearing aid. If you're not familiar with what I'm talking about, good.Small ears and sensitivities to high pitched sounds beware.Edit: Oh yeah, and they did not do a good job of cancelling wind at all. It sounded like I was in a tornado. There are much better brands out there.

"R3RJJF6YI9I84W","Microlighter","I bought these as a backup to AirPods Pro and they are both very good.Pros - noise cancellation is better than AirPods Pro! Feel better made than the air pods pro and sound quality is excellent. They are a little heavier on the ears and it’s fairly straight forward to switch between paired devices especially using the charging case button. No issues with connectivityCons - not as good as AirPods Pro on IOS devices where switching is seamless. The biggest downside is that you can set the shortcut to SKIP FORWARD OR SKIP BACK A TRACK BUT NOT BOTH. This is nonsense and only requires a software upgrade so come on BOSE it would be nice to be able to skip forward or back from the earbuds without having to revert to the phone or app.UPDATE: After using these for about a month they really are quite uncomfortable - very heavy and uncomfortable to wear after a short time - also its very difficult to get a good seal with the supplied ear tips which then makes the ANC quite variable - Not worth the money and will be going back","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 August 2022","OK but could do with a few tweaks and not up to usual BOSE standards","2.0 out of 5 stars","","5","Triple Black"

"R35LHKGR50CDLH","Glassman","I've had my earbuds for about 6 months. I bought them as a replacement for some PowerBeats Pros, which were excellent but I was after something with noise cancellation when working from home.Initially, I was really impressed. The sound and noise-cancellation are brilliant. They're comfortable to wear - my ears are on the large side but they fit very snugly with the right adaptor. The hands-free signals (play/pause, volume, noise cancellation) work pretty well.However, the connection seems really glitchy on the iPhone. Sometimes it connects automatically, sometimes you need to use the app. Sometimes it will drop out and you have to reconnect. This is markedly worse than the PowerBeats Pros which connected seamlessly and switch seamlessly between devices.The earphones won't connect to a Windows PC which amazed me. So I need to buy separate headphones for zoom?!Finally, I dropped the protective charging case on the floor. The case did its job and the earbuds were fine but the tiny latch that closes the case snapped off and cannot be fixed (and the box can't be replaced) so now I am left with earbuds that are on all the time, they connect intermittently to my phone which is annoying and they also continually drain the battery.Overall, great sound and very comfortable but connectivity is not at all good.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 July 2021","Mixed bag","2.0 out of 5 stars","","21","Triple Black"

You cannot charge your buds wirelessly in the case anymore. ALSO, you CANNOT pair your earbuds to any new device because Bose designed these buds to be locked to the ORIGINAL battery charging case.THEN to add insult to the wound...I had to contact support in another country (800 Number and the bose.com chat) and they lied to me and hung up on me over 3 times.

Es macht einfach keinen Spaß. Gerade wenn man Sport macht, muss man am Ende die Lautstärke am iPHONE regulieren, das nervt SEHR.2.

Und klanglich gehört er in die Top 4 Kategorie, auch wenn er manchmal etwas quäkig in den Mitten und dünn in den unteren Mitten klingt.Aber was gar nicht geht, ist das Rauschen. Das Grundrauschen ist immer vorhanden. Mal weniger, mal stärker ausgeprägt, anscheinend abhängig von der Trageerkennung. Das Rauschen wird umso lauter, je mehr man das ANC reduziert. Da man das ANC nicht abschalten kann und Bose auch absolut kein Interesse an Kundenwünschen zeigt, wie man in den Foren überall nachlesen kann, wird sich das auch nicht ändern.Es fehlt auch ein Equalizer, um seine persönliche Signatur einzustellen. Auch kann man nur weiter und nicht zurück skippen. Was bitte, soll denn der Blödsinn? Und die Lautstärkeregelung ist so grobstufig, dass man letztlich sowieso den Player nimmt und die Lautstärke dort reguliert.Dann ist die Verarbeitung typisch amerikanisch, nämlich schlecht. Der linke Hörer weist Spaltmaße auf, die nicht mehr schön sind.Telefonieren klappt sehr gut und das ANC ist auch gut. Kann aber nur im Bassbereich überzeugen. Zu den Mitten hin, wie das Rauschen eines Ventilators, ist das ANC nur unterdurchschnittlich gut. Ausserdem scheint die Intensität mit dem Ladezustand zusammenzuhängen. Frisch aus der Box ist es gut, mit der Zeit wird es schlechter. Oder man gewöhnt sich daran. Will ich nicht ausschliessen.Überzeugend ist die Akkulaufzeit und Ladezeit. Aber für über 200€ muss da mehr kommen. Aktuell sehe ich die Hörer keinesfalls im Oberpreissegment angesiedelt und der UVP von 279€ ist ein Scherz.Zum Vergleich habe ich einen Sony wf1000xm3 und einen Jabra 85t und andere.

I noticed a crack on the right earbud a couple days later and got a replacement sent. Mind you, I waited to ship them so I wouldn't get the same set back. When the new pair arrived, the first thing I did was check to see if they had a crack in them. They had the same crack on the right earpiece. Now Amazon won't send another replacement so I need to return and reorder.Part 2 - Headphones Themselves: These headphones sound absolutely fantastic. The same Bose sound we all know and love, with a little more mid and high end for more clarity on vocals and punch. These headphones sound outstanding. The ANC is fantastic, especially for a pair of in-ears. You can control how much you'd like in the app. Around 50-60% is what you'd expect with their older in ear models with just a tight passive fit, 0% is basically an ambient mode, so you can still hear everything around you, so long as your volume is below 60%, and 100% on the ANC slider cancels out anything that isn't an abrupt and extremely loud noise. Think metal clashing with great force about three feet away.All in all, these headphones are fantastic. But I do not want my brand new headphones to have a noticeable crack in them.

Klang / Passform:Der Klang ist stark vom Sitz abhängig und dieser ist wiederum von den mitgelieferten Einsätzen abhängig. Bei mir zumindest passte keiner der drei. Die Dinger klemmten entweder oder fielen mir aus dem Ohr. Schade.2. Bedienung / App:Die Bedienung ist unübersichtlich und die App hilft dabei nicht.- Die Doppel-Taps aufs Ohr muss man recht kräftig machen. Dadurch sind diese sehr laut und tun fast weh.- Das ""Finger-auf-Earbud-legen-und-warten"" wiederum wird sehr häufig erkannt. Auch dann, wenn man die Teile gerade einsetzt oder eine Mütze aufhat. Beim Rumprobieren der Einsätze habe ich ständig Siri ausgelöst. Dies ist auch in der App nicht abschaltbar. Nervig.- Das ""Streichen-um-Lautstärke-zu-verändern"" ist unzuverlässig und sehr grob. Achtung: Da kann man sich schon mal sehr lauten Pegel ins Ohr blasen.- Man braucht zwingend die neue ""Bose Music"" App. Mit der alten ""Bose Connect"" kommt man nicht weiter. Außerdem braucht man ein Bose-Konto.- Ein Schmunzler beim Einrichten: Um mit Hilfe der Handy-App ein zweites Gerät mit den Earbuds zu verbinden, muss man die Bluetooth-Verbindung mit dem Handy erst trennen. Logischerweise kann man dann die App dann nicht mehr benutzen; man hat die Verbindung zu den Earbuds ja gerade getrennt.3. Latenz:Verbindet man die Earbuds mit einem Mac und will einen Film schauen, erlebt man eine böse Überraschung: Der Ton ist um ca. 300 msec verzögert. Lippenbewegungen und Sprache passen also nicht mehr zusammen. Filmgenuss ist so kaum mehr möglich.Schade, aber für diesen Preis hatte ich mehr erwartet.","Reviewed in Germany on 10 January 2021","Hätte mehr erwartet","2.0 out of 5 stars","","5","Soapstone"
"R1CO0KHJ57JZX9","AirNelson","I am on the phone 3-4 hours a day in a noisy office environment so I purchased them for work hoping they would provide better noise cancelling than my AirPod Pro's. The overall noise cancelling is on par with the AirPod Pro's except it does not block deep voices as well. It is far better than the AirPods with high frequency noises and a bit better with the drone of an airplane while sitting in the back row. I will either be returning them or selling them for the following reasons: 1) Slow to pair with my iPhone 7 when removed from the case. 2) When they do pair, one side goes 'ding' and then the other. Left and Right do not connect at the same time. 3) They do not unpair from the iPhone 7 when reinstalled to the case. (I have to turn Bluetooth off) 4) The most annoying thing of all, the volume of getting a text or email is extremely loud and does not change with ringer volume and I cannot find any way to turn it down.I have had several Bose over the ear headphones over the years, as they are a great product, but Bose needs to refine these QuietComfort Noise Cancelling Earbuds so the interactive experience is similar to the AirPod Pros. If already have the AirPods and an iPhone, I would not recommend these as a replacement.","Reviewed in the United States on 16 November 2021","Great noise cancelling, but not for the office","2.0 out of 5 stars","","3","Triple Black"

Voice updates that doesn't sound like a beta from a 1998 Windows programme.I refunded this product sharpish and will continue with the buds pro.

"R2N0942TVBE8VJ","Antonio","El costo de estos audífonos no vale por la calidad que traen, son un plástico nada cómodo al tacto, trae tecnología que puedes controlar al tacto de los audífonos como subir, bajar volumen, pausar, pero es muy sensible y muy seguido se confunde entre pausar canción o activar el asistente de voz, lo único que queda es desactivarle las funciones táctiles…En cuanto a comodidad en el oído, en lo personal no me funciono porque el eartip mas pequeño que trae es de 25mm, a mi ese aún me queda un poco grande, en la página oficial de Bose existe un artículo que se llama Eartips+, que son un paquete de Eartips (gomitas que van al oído) en otros tamaños, uno más pequeño (size 0), tamaño medio (1+) y grande (2+). Lamentablemente este artículo solo se vende en USA y no puedo adquirirlo en mi país, tenía contemplado quedarme los audífonos y en algún momento intentar que se acomodara de la manera correcta una vez que tuviera ese size 0 en los eartips, pero el conseguirlos será un lío y por eso decidí regresar el producto.En cuestión a la calidad de audio, tenía la idea de que sonarían mejor comparado con sus artículos pasados como los earbuds sport, pero es lo mismo, la única diferencia es la cancelación de ruido que si es de reconocer es buena, pero lo que es bajos, graves es muy normal, por el precio se puede conseguir unos audífonos con mejor calidad de audio, hablo de skullcandy, algún modelo senheizzer que te aportaran un sonido mucho mejor.","Reviewed in Mexico on 13 October 2022","Es un producto comercial calidad-precio no cumple expectativas","2.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Soapstone"

"R3KWSGOBE1TQ1P","Björn","Ich war auf der Suche nach neuen Bluetooth in ear Kopfhörern für meine Apple Watch, da ich bisher nur kabelgebundene Kopfhörer besitze. Die Kopfhörer sollten mobil sein um mich auf dem Weg zur Arbeit und beim Sport zu begleiten.Aus diesem Grund habe ich mir 4 Modelle bestellt:Bowers & Wilkins PI4Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2Sony WF-1000XM3Perfekt war keiner davon, ich schreibe mal meine Pros und Cons im Vergleich zu den jeweils anderen Drei auf:Bowers & Wilkins PI4+ Sehr gute Tonqualität mit dem besten Bass+ Höchste mögliche Lautstärke und dabei komplett verzerrungsfrei+ Sehr bequem (wenn man die StayHear+ oder die StayHear Ultra Silikonaufsetze verwendet, die super passen, dann genauso bequem wie die Bose. Die StayHear+ sind bequemer, die StayHear Ultra haben eine etwas bessere passive Geräuschdämmung)+ Können nicht verloren gehen, da mit Nackenband. Man muss auch nichts in den Hosentaschen mit herumtragen, da die Kopfhörer um den Nacken hängen.+ Multipair mit bis zu 2 Geräten gleichzeitig+ Kabelnutzung über USB. Schließt man die Kopfhörer zum Laden an den USB Port eines PCs an, kann man das PC Audio über Kabel an den Kopfhörern wiedergeben.+ Nutzung während des Ladens+ Sehr hochwertige Materialien und Verarbeitung. Alles aus Metall und hochwertigem Gummi.+ Besitzt die größten Treiber (14,2mm)+ Sehr gute passive Dämmung+ Haptische Bedienungsknöpfe+ Sehr angenehme integrierte Stimme beim Wechseln der ANC Modi+ Halten sehr gut im Ohr- Berührung der Kabel erzeugen ein Geräusch in den Kopfhörern- Kabel etwas lang, so dass sie nach vorne abstehen- ANC nicht das Beste, aber durchaus nützlich- Mikrofon sehr leise beim Telefonieren oder bei Sprachaufnahmen- Ohren fühlen sich geschlossen an- Kein Equalizer+- Bluetooth Verbindung braucht anscheinend viel CPU Leistung vom Handy. Wenn mein Handy überfordert ist, weil es gerade eine Website lädt und ich schon nach unten wische wie ein verrückter, dann hängt die Verbindung. Zuerst dachte ich, es läge allgemein an der Verbindung, aber ich konnte den Fall immer wieder rekonstruieren. Hier ist also eher die Leistung des Handys/der Smartwatch das Problem+- Die Musik spielt eher im Kopf als außerhalb+- Die Differenzierung der einzelnen Töne/Instrumente ist nicht perfekt, aber immer noch sehr gutBose QC Earbuds+ ANC ist der Hammer!+ Die Bequemsten die es gibt (noch minimal bequemer als die B&W PI4 mit den StayHear+ Aufsetzen)+ Bass regelt sich automatisch nach Lautstärke (so hört man bei sehr leiser Wiedergabe auch noch Bass)++ Halten sehr gut im Ohr- Differenzierung einzelner Töne/Instrumente Fließt eher alles zusammen, vor allem wenn viel auf einmal spielt-  ANC lässt sich nicht deaktivieren!!! Stellt man das ANC runter, dann wird automatisch das Pass Through hochgestellt. Ein no go bei Wind/Joggen/Fahrradfahren, da ich hier immer, egal bei welcher Einstellung ein starkes Rauschen habe.- Schreckliche Computerstimme bei Connect/Disconnect- Sehr großes Ladecase (nicht für die Hosentasche)- Kein Equalizer- Verbindung nur mit einem Gerät gleichzeitig+- Insgesamt sehr gute Soundqualität, allerdings schlechter als die Mitbewerber+- Die Musik spielt eher im Kopf als außerhalb+- Mikrofonqualität ist okSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2+ Bühne -> Die Musik kommt hier definitiv von außen, Die Kopfhörer erzeugen eine sehr gute Räumlichkeit+ Soundqualität ist super+ Die Differenzierung von Tönen/Instrumenten gelingt hier am Besten+ Sehr schönes Case+ Halten sehr gut im Ohr- Das ANC ist leider nicht sonderlich stark allerdings nützlich. Es ist stärker als bei den B&W PI4- Tragekomfort ist nicht perfekt, nach 1-2 Stunden konnte ich sie nicht mehr tragen, auch wenn sie anfangs garnicht zu spüren waren. Anders bei den Bose und B&W hier spürt man die Ohrhörer immer, aber sie werden nie unangenehm+- Die passive Geräuschdämmung ist nicht hoch, dadurch spürt man aber auch keine Dämpfung während des Tragens.+- Vorhandener Equalizer, allerdings nur grob, es gibt keinen Band-EqualizerSony WF-1000XM3- Hält nicht im Ohr, egal mit welchen Aufsätzen. Hier passen auch die Aufsätze von den Sennheisern drauf, welche dafür gesorgt haben, dass die Sennheiser sehr gut in meinen Ohren sitzen. Die Sony fallen allerdings auch mit den Sennheiser Aufsätzen nach dreimal Kopfschütteln raus.Aus diesem Grund konnte ich die Sony leider nicht weiter testenFazit:Aus Tragekomfort Gründen war letztlich nur noch die Entscheidung zwischen den Bose und den B&W zu fällen.Am liebsten hätte ich die Funktionen und den Bass der B&W in Kombination mit dem ANC (aber deaktivierbar) sowie dem Tragekomfort der Bose und der Differenziertheit sowie Bühne der Sennheiser gehabt.Auch der Preis ist in meine Entscheidung mit eingeflossen:B&W 120€ Amazon Warehouse sehr gutBose 220€ neuSennheiser 255€ neuWenn bei den Bose das ANC deaktivierbar gewesen wäre, hätte ich evtl. diese genommen, da das einfach der Hammer ist! So ist allerdings was das Gesamtpaket und vor allem auch den Preis angeht, der B&W PI4 für mich der Beste Kopfhörer aus dieser Auswahl. Für 300€ hätte ich ihn vermutlich nicht gekauft, dann hätte ich keinen der Kopfhörer genommen und entweder einen Over Ear oder erstmal weitere In Ears getestet. Für 120€ kann man hier aber definitiv nichts falsch machen und hat wunderbare Allround sport Kopfhörer, die man sogar stationär mit Kabel betreiben kann.","Reviewed in Germany on 2 February 2021","ANC nicht deaktivierbar!

"R3NNZI2X4K2B6X","Amaki","In short, these have a decent sound signature for music, decent noise cancelling, good battery life, and are very comfortably made. However, the passive noise isolation is quite bad so it brings down the quality of the noise cancelling.Also for this price, they're lacking in some features like customizable touch controls and an in-app equalizer which I would've thought were basically guaranteed on pricey wireless earbuds like these.Pros-(1)- Quite comfortable. I fell asleep with them on and woke up without any pain in my ears.-(2)- The case is hard to open because it's locked close with a button latch. I consider this a good thing because I prefer my earbuds to be secure in their case.Neutrals-(3)- Noise cancelling is ""fairly"" good. These seem to cancel noises properly, but are let down by their somewhat lacking passive noise isolation (preventing noise through the earbud itself) so you can still hear louder noises directly through the earbuds even if they're technically ""cancelling"" it. When I used these during my transit via train, I could constantly hear the low rumble of the heater fans and the high-pitch whirring of the motors when the train sped up or slowed down.As a side note, the noise cancelling is decent at not picking up wind gusts, although medium/strong wind gusts still cause a small amount of noise.-(4)- The default sound signature is quite nice and it'll probably satisfy a lot of people, but there's something about it that's lacking ""fun"". It has good clarity in mids and highs without being too harsh, and the bass is there albeit a bit pulled back. My issue lies with how the sub-bass below the bass is so pulled back that there's basically no ""oomph"" to any song I listen to which has sub-bass.-(5)- So far I haven't had any issues with connectivity, even in the middle of downtown. The only connection issue I've had is that the earbuds sometimes stutter for ~1 second every now and then (but only once or twice a day) before reconnecting like nothing happened.Cons-(6)- The passive sound isolation is pretty weak. I mentioned this when I talked about how it makes the noise cancelling worse, but it also prevents you from listening to music at medium/high volume. This is because your music just bleeds right out and you become a nuisance to everyone around you.With how much sound gets past the noise cancelling because of the lacking passive noise isolation, you end up wanting to listen to music at a slightly higher volume to drown out the extra outside noise, but doing that makes your noise leak out to your surroundings. The lacking noise isolation just brings about a lose-lose situation.-(7)- These are missing so many basic music controls it's not even funny. The only 2 touch controls you have for music are double-tap right earbud for play/pause, and press-and-hold left earbud to go to the next track. This is LITERALLY all you get as touch options. Every other touch combination is for calls and phone helper stuff with no options to customize them whatsoever.I am most certainly not happy about this lack of customization for the touch controls. The touch controls should let me play/pause, skip to next/previous track, and volume +/- if I want them to. If touch controls are the reason for these limitations, I would've preferred the physical buttons like the ones on the Bose SoundSport Free.Edit (2022-10-02): I've heard the app apparently lets you customize the touch controls now, so that's good to hear. Too bad it wasn't like that on release.-(8)- There's no equalizer in the Bose app. Sure, the default sound signature is okay and you could argue for third-party equalizers, but why don't they give us a simple equalizer in the app for these pricey $350 earbuds?ConclusionPersonally, I wouldn't recommend these simply because the passive noise isolation is weak. These earbuds do get quite a bit done right, like comfort and sound, but the weak noise isolation takes it down quite a few ranks.[--A bit about these compared to Sony WF-1000XM3's--]Since I have the Sony WF-1000XM3's which are basically direct competitors to these, I'll just point out that the Sony WF-1000XM3's are cheaper and have all the extra features which these Bose don't have.For instance, you can customize almost all your touch controls on the Sony, and there's an in-app equalizer to adjust the sound to your taste.Where the Sony's lose out to the Bose is in terms of water protection and comfort/fit. The Sony's have the absolute stupidest design when it comes to comfort/fit with no ear wings to hold the earbuds in your ears, so these Bose are 500% better at staying in your ears comfortably.","Reviewed in Canada on 19 October 2020","These are pretty good, but the customization feels lacking for the price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","","142","Triple Black"
"R1Y223Z7IOZQG8","Gilbert Escobar","[Update 12/3] - They just added volume controls which is a really big deal. I'm leaving at 3 stars until they can add multi-point and because I discovered a super annoying ""feature"" that perhaps is only a problem with my pair. I've added it to my list of cons - Transparency Mode/ANC Level 0, Ouch my Ears!Disclosure: This review comes from someone that mainly listens to Hip Hop, Metal, Dubstep, or Reggaetón. So my standard for audio may differ from others.Also I will be comparing these to 4 other in-ear headphones.1. Bose SoundSport Wired In-Ear Headphones (Pictured far left)2. Google Pixel Buds (Pictured second from the left)3. Bose SoundSport Wireless (Pictured second from the right)4. AirPods Pro (not pictured)Let me start by saying that I want to give these a higher rating but 3 stars is how I honestly feel based on how they are priced and the gripes I have with them. My standards may be too high.PROS• Comfort. Just what you would expect from Bose. The new ear tips make them more comfortable than the  SoundSport Wireless and just as comfortable as the SoundSport Wired. They are also very secure and not as heavy as I was expecting despite their size.• ANC. The Noise Cancelling is top notch! Arguably better than AirPods Pro. The transparency mode/passthrough is also great when ANC is set to 0. But I would argue that it sounds a bit more natural on the Air Pods Pro. THIS IS WHAT YOU’RE PAYING FOR, and it’s almost worth it.• Sound. For me, the sound is far superior to the Air Pods Pro. They have way better bass and the sound signature is exactly what I’ve come to expect from Bose. They sound way better than Bose SoundSport Wireless and are on par if not better than SoundSport Wired. It really depends on the device you are connected to though. For some reason the buds sound way better (louder) on my Pixel 4a than my iPhone Xr. I’m not 100% sure why but my guess would be that the iPhone Xr only supports Bluetooth 5.0.• Charging. Qi Wireless and USBC charging make these feel modern and extremely convenient. Making them on par to the Pixel Buds and AirPods Pro• Touch controls. Really nice to have feature and I am glad its there. But the execution is lacking compared to Pixel Buds. So much so, it's almost a con. [Update] 12/3. These now have volume control straight from the Ear Buds!CONS• The case. It’s unreasonably large and only offers 12 additional hours of charge. Compared to the Pixel Buds and AirPods Pro, which offer a significantly smaller case and longer charge times, this is a bit embarrassing for Bose to not offer something competitive in this area for the price point. I also prefer a magnetic lid vs a push button.• Independent use/functionality. I can confirm that you can use either bud independently. But you lose functionality depending on which one you are using. The touch controls are almost on par to the Airpods Pro, with one exception, you can’t go back a track. However, the Bose QC earbuds really start to show their poor execution when you use the buds individually. If you take one of the earbuds out, the music will stop as anticipated. When you place the removed earbud in the case, the bud still on ear will make a sound like it’s powered off; however, when you play your media on your device, the sound will come through the earbud still in your ear, even if the other bud is in the case. This sounds cool and all until you realize that certain touch controls are assigned to only one bud or the other. Only using the left bud causes you to lose the ability to answer calls, play/pause music through touch controls because those features are assigned to the right bud only. Only using the right ear causes you to lose the ability to forward a song/hear battery level or toggle between 3 customizable ANC settings because those features are assigned to the left bud only. The Pixel Buds have the best touch controls by far, which allow you to use basically all the same controls on either bud, and allows you to lower and increase volume while the Bose QC earbuds do not. With that said, you can still accomplish all of the above through the Bose Music App. [Update] everything I've said about this is still true but I left out one major limitation. The mic only works on the right earbud, making the left bud unusable on its own for phone calls. Which may be why you can only invoke the voice assistant with the right bud. Not a huge gripe for me, but I've seen a lot of contradicting statements on this functionality and wanted to provide as much detail as I could come up with.• Multipoint. This by far is my biggest gripe. This is such a great feature present in the Bose SoundSport Wireless, but the feature is sadly missing on the QC Earbuds. The feature allows you to seamlessly switch between two devices, and even toggle up to 7 devices right from the device. The new app required to use the QC Earbuds also doesn’t really make it easy to switch devices on the fly. This makes switching between devices feel cumbersome and not modern at all. Especially considering that Apple just added similar functionality to the AirPods Pro (only supported with other apple products).• Find my buds. Also missing here. I was really hoping these had this feature as I anticipate misplacing them often. Feature present in older Bose earbuds, Pixel Buds, and AirPod Pros.• Price. The pricepoint is way too high considering how much the AirPod Pros do better than the QC Earbuds. In a battle of Sound and ANC, Bose takes the clear win. But when it comes down to features/functionality, AirPods Pro is the clear winner for me.• [Update 12/3] Transparency Mode/ANC Level 0, Ouch my Ears! . I've discovered that some sounds are amplified through the earbuds when using them with Noise Cancelling set to 0. The setting is supposed to allow you to hear your surroundings which works fine. But if you leave them in your ear to and are not listening to music or on a call, some sounds are way too loud and kinda hurt my ear. 😢 (Examples. Shutting a car door, clinking sounds, or glass breaking). Basically I cannot leave them in my ear when not in use because I'm afraid one day some unknown sound will cause damage to my ear. This is very inconvenient, especially because carrying the case around is also inconvenient due to its size. So I basically only use them exclusively around my house when consuming media. I then immediately take them off. I honestly feel like taking another star off because of this.Conclusion: The perfect earbuds don’t exist. These almost checked all my boxes. I love the buds for their comfort, amazing sound, and superior ANC. I really like how they look despite their larger size. But for the price I expect to have all the features, with no compromises. I don’t really understand why Bose would release these with the present limitations and lack of features from previous devices. With all of that said, I would still rate these above the other earbuds solely based on Sound and ANC.My ratings based on these factors: Age, Form Factor, Sound, Price, Functionality1. Bose SoundSport Wired In-Ear Headphones (Pictured far left) – 5 Stars (not comparable), perfect wired in-ear headphones at the time with great sound and comfort. Worth every penny if you can find them at the original price.2. Google Pixel Buds (Pictured second from the left) – 2 Stars (somewhat comparable), Best touch controls by far, but they really hurt my ears, and the sound is just okay. Totally overpriced at $180.3. Bose SoundSport Wireless (Pictured second from the right) – 2 stars (not comparable), I loved having them around my neck at all times and the Multipoint feature is awesome. But the build quality was terrible, and the sound was okay. Pricing wasn’t terrible for what they offered, but the build quality makes them hard to recommend.4. AirPods Pro (not pictured) – 3 stars (Most Comparable), AirPods Pro are jam-packed with amazing features in such a tiny form factor. They truly are kind of magical. But for me the sound quality was not worth the price tag ($220).5. Bose QuietComfort Earbuds – 3 stars, amazing sound and ANC, but lacks in the features department quite considerably. I think pricing them at $220 would have easily bumped these up to 4 stars for me and would make them extremely competitive against the AirPods Pro. At that pricepoint I would gladly trad off features for better sound and ANC. If Bose is somehow able to patch in some of the missing features through software updates I will update my rating. But I'm thinking it may comedown to hardware limitations. So for now, it's 3 stars and I'm still on the hunt for the perfect earbuds. :(","Reviewed in the United States on 14 October 2020","Way better than the AirPods Pro???","3.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719n57ih7SL.jpg

"R1SA8RR90RK2KT","mouette-rieuse","Fidèle à Bose depuis des années et à son exceptionnelle réduction de bruit (j’avais le casque filaire, puis Blutooth), j’attendais d’avoir enfin des écouteurs intra-auriculaires a réduction de bruit pour investir à nouveau (environ) 300€ pour un format plus discret et « transportable ».Le gros plus est la qualité de la réduction de bruit (pour avoir essayé de nombreuses marques, c’est indéniablement LE gros point fort de Bose!). De ce côté là, pas de déception.A première vue, je trouve les écouteurs un peu trop imposants, mais la technologie demande sûrement cette taille d’écouteurs...ce qui est déjà une prouesse mais je suis certaine que cette taille réduira dans quelques années.Et au final, ces écouteurs sont assez légers, et les embouts sont bien conçus pour la stabilité et isoler du bruit.Par contre, grosse déception: PAS DE RÉGLAGE DU VOLUME DIRECTEMENT SUR LES ÉCOUTEURS. Il vous faudra passer par l’option « assistant vocal » pour monter ou baisser le son via votre smartphone. Donc si vous voulez modifier le volume, tout le monde entendra vos directives...pas génial...Pourquoi proposer l’option « vérification de la batterie » comme seule commande alternative avec l’avance ou le recul sur vôtre playlist??? Pourquoi ne pas l’annoncer lors de la connexion comme pour l’équivalent en casque fermé Bluetooth??? Cette option aurait pu être remplacée par le volume...mais da obligerait choisir entre réglage du volume OU de la sélection des morceaux...la encore, bof bof...Autre gros point noir, il faut déconnecter le Bluetooth de l’iPhone pour passer à celui de l’iPad au lieu de basculer lorsque le son est éteint sur l’iPhone et que celui de l’iPad démarre comme mon casque QuietComfort35: donc un gros manque de fluidité à ce niveau là aussi...J’avoue ne pas comprendre le bouton de connexion Bluetooth sur le boîtier et pas l’un des écouteurs??? Manifestement, les concepteurs ont du faire des choix pour que ceux ci ne soient pas aussi gros que des balles de ping-pong. Mais ça, ça peut éventuellement passer...Autre problème, je trouve que les écouteurs se sont déchargés super vite!!!À pleine charge lors de l’ouverture, quelques minutes à écouter de la musique, je les remets dans le boîtier jusqu’à ce soir et bam, plus de batterie au bout de 30 secondes alors que les voyants du boîtier étaient à 3/4 lors de l’ouverture, ils ne sont plus qu’à 1/4 quand je remets mes écouteurs pour les charger. Et le boîtier s’est éteint en quelques secondes et la..il charge...bof bof...Dernier point par top: le boîtier marque vite les traces de doigts et l’ouverture doit être faite à 2 mains car le bouton est un peu difficile à ouvrir...dommage...Ça fait beaucoup de « bof » pour un appareil à 280€!Le son est très bon (même si je trouve les basses un peu trop présentes), la réduction de bruit est fidèle à Bose, MAIS on sent qu’ils ont voulu sortir un modèle intra auriculaire avant Noël, quitte à « bâcler » certains aspects essentiels: réglage du volume, batterie fiable, fluidité de connexion Bluetooth...Je pense attendre que Bose améliore ce produit et me contenter d’autres écouteurs intra-auriculaires d’ici là, certes moins performants en terme de qualité de son ou de réduction de bruit, mais offrant plus de confort ergonomique et moins chers...","Reviewed in France on 14 October 2020","Peut mieux faire...","3.0 out of 5 stars","","153","Triple Black"
"R186QXSKG2RJC8","chaw704352","Raised from 2 stars to 3 (12/4). Volume control now on-bud!Some increased usability through firmware and App updates. Still has flaws.CONSUNSTABLE BLUETOOTH: Bluetooth connectivity drops out, switches devices oddly or drops off one ear while you are using them. Using them with a computer (on MS Teams) gives a ton of background noise and feedback, so you can't use them on a ""Teams"" call. Note that connecting to the Bose UC USB adapter cleans this noise. NOTE THIS HAS IMPROVED WITH UPDATES. STILL NOT THE BEST OF BREED.WON'T CONNECT TO ITS ANDROID APP: Bose Music application worked for a few days. But now refuses to connect to the earbuds. it can find them, it just won't connect and allow you to change any settings. (App is terrible anyway...with almost no functionality other than volume and Noise Reduction settings). NOTE THIS IS NOW MUCH MORE STABLE AFTER A FEW APP UPDATES.NOT AS COMFORTABLE AS OLDER BOSE BUDS: While the original QC earbuds (corded) were super comfortable in the ear, these have an additional hump (part of the hard plastic) that makes them uncomfortable after about 1hr. This did not happen with prior QC buds i have owned. Also, the silicone is harder than the clear silicone they used to use (used to be a 2-part supersoft / slightly stiffer combination material for the comfort-tips)...now it is all the harder silicone, which is just not as comfortable. The old QC buds...I could wear for an entire day without discomfort (except sweat...which is unavoidable). These cause some physical PAIN. NO CHANGE IN MY OPINION... THESE ARE GOOD FOR 2HRS BEFORE MY EARS HURT AND I HAVE TO SWITCH HEADPHONES.Pretty much only tolerate these things for this price. I have probably 20 sets of earphones. I love buying and testing them. These are probably worth $199-$225 with the list of flaws. Not nearly $300. Only thing that sets them apart from Sony are the comfort-tips....but they made these less comfortable too with the new plastic hump that sits on your ear cartridge next to your skull.CASE IS VERY LARGE AND NOT POCKETABLE: The case is extremely thick. You will not want to put this in any pants pockets. Only a jacket or a backpack or purse. They should have made this wider and thinner. Not a big deal for me as I mostly use in travel with a backpack.BATTERY LIFE NOT GREAT: I get 3 to 4 hours before the notifications begin. This is not the headset for international air travel or even long domestic flights. Plus, just not comfortable enough for that anyway. Yes, you can case charge them, but on an airplane, you're stuck with no hearing protection for 15 minutes. Wish I could get 6 hours at least.(Fixed WITH 12/3 APP UPDATE) NO VOLUME CONTROL ON BUDS: FIXED... BUT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN RELEASED BEFORE THIS WAS READY... SHAME ON YOU BOSE. No volume control on buds. You can pull a bud out to pause. But if you want to raise or lower volume of a call or music, you have to go to your phone or laptop. This is not only dangerous for hearing, it is a massive oversight. Sony had the same issue in their higher end buds and eventually released a firmware update. Bose needs to add volume to the Favorite settings.NO EQUALIZER ANYWHERE: These don't work with the Bose Connect app... Only the Bose Music app. This has no equalizer. Hope you like lots of bass. If you are used to slightly overdriven Bose low and and highs.... You'll be fine. They do sound great, but wish I could flatten the EQ CURVE. And for comparison... These have probably 30%-50% more bass than the 700s. I wish the 700s had a bit more bass and the Buds had a bit less. But I prefer the sound of the Buds to the 700s either way.SINGLE DEVICE CONNECTION, NO SWITCHING: Only one device connected at a time! So if you use a computer and your phone, you have to disconnect first from one, then connect to the other. It is really PAINFUL PROCESS. THIS STILL IRKS ME. I USE MY 700 HEADPHONES INSTEAD OF BUDS FOR THIS REASON. HATE SWITCHING DEVICES.... AND YOU HAVE TO TURN OFF YOUR PHONE BLUETOOTH TO SWITCH. REALLY REALLY ANNOYING!!PROSSOUND: I prefer these to 700 bose headphones for music. Have more bass and just a crisper sound you get with buds vs over ears. 700 wins hands down on conference calls though.LOOKS: on video calls, these are much less intrusive looking than a giant over ear headset like the 700. While the 700 sounds better for calls, I sometimes prefer the small profile of the buds to appear more professional and less like a DJ.PORTABILITY: while the case is huge, this is easier to travel with than the 700s or QCs.COMFORT TIPS: bose corners the market on this style of tip. Yes it goes in the ear, but it doesn't create a sweaty vacuum seal like others. This means less booming noises when you walk or move around. Still the best in the market. I still hate the new hard plastic hump that hurts my ear, though. Original QC buds didn't have that painful thing. Hopefully your ears are shaped more accommodatingly.","Reviewed in the United States on 16 October 2020","RAISED FROM 2 STARS TO 3 WITH APP UPDATES: multi device abscence and ear comfort still an issue","3.0 out of 5 stars","","27","Soapstone"
"RZF366QO242J9","my name is unimportant","I purchased these wildly expensive headphones to help actually hear things I was going to be listening to anyway in my extremely loud work environment. Admittedly, I might be in circumstances that are a little harsher than most users of these headphones, but for the price tag, I kind of expected these to be a little better than what they actually are. First off, the charging case is way more fragile than I ever thought it would've been. It fell out of my pocket not even two weeks into owning my pair and the internal mechanism that keeps it shut snapped and the case no longer stays closed on its own. I've taken to wrapping a rubber band around it to solve the issue, and that isn't enough to make me not want to use these, but it is kind of strange that something at this price point could take such a fall from such a low height and break like that. After a solid three months of use, the battery charge indicator lights on the outside of the case have also started to become inaccurate and aren't reliable. It already requires me to put it on charge again more than any other rechargeable product I've ever purchased, save for perhaps my 10 year old laptop. And it's only been *three* months.The earphones have odd connection problems sometimes that I have a hard time figuring out. Sometimes only one earphone will work, or one earphone's noise cancelling will work but the other won't, or sometimes they will say they're connected to my phone, my phone will say it is connected to them, but no audio will come out. A quick tuck back into their case (closed and rubber banded shut) for a few minutes usually fixes it, thankfully, but it's still a rather annoying issue to come across every couple of days or so. Sometimes the magnets that keep the earphones charging will slide just ever so barely slightly out of position and the earphones will not recharge, frustrating me during a very long day at work. Then there's the issue of battery life: I'm lucky if these get me to 6 hours. With other competitors on the market pushing 8 hours, I gotta say I'm not impressed.The touch controls are a little wonky sometimes. Lately, it seems that they've become less and less responsive. I have to double tap two or three times to get the noise canceling mode to change or to pause, and it often completely misreads my taps to pause as an attempt to change the volume. This becomes perhaps the most irritating issue of all when something happens that requires me to turn the noise cancelling down/off and pause my music quickly. The worst though (and to be fair, it happens with other bluetooth headphones too, not just the Bose) is when it misinterprets a volume press as a voice assistant press, who then interprets the background noise around me as a request and decides to call someone at random from my contacts list. That's lead to some awkward situations.In terms of fit and comfort, that too is inconsistent. Some days they'll fit perfectly and I won't even be able to tell I have them on, other days (MOST days, to be honest) they'll start hurting four hours in, and other days still they fall out of my ears. They especially seem prone to falling out when I'm on the phone with others and they've got me smiling or laughing. The headphones come with three different sized caps to accommodate for different ear sizes, as is pretty standard for most earphones, but none of them seem to fit my ears particularly well. I must have the most strange ear canals in the world...The real secret main reason I bought these, finally, was for making calls in those loud environments, and, well... meh. Even when I'm in quieter environments my conversational partners seem to find it hard to hear me and that's a bummer. At this price point, you should be able to hear my guts moving my food around as I talk! Disappointing.All that being said, though, these aren't bad headphones. They do what I need them to do, for the most part. They make the horribly loud noises I'm surrounded by all day long tolerably soft. Sometimes I wear them not even to listen to music or talk to others, but just to have some layer of noise dampening so I feel a little less like I'm going deaf. When I do listen to music, it sounds crisp and clear (maybe a *little* less bass-y than I prefer, but we can't have everything!) and it's much easier to hear the people I'm talking to on calls. I don't strictly speaking regret buying them, but I do wish they were a little cheaper, or that some of these issues were ironed out a little better at the price point they're at.","Reviewed in the United States on 16 March 2021","Could be better","3.0 out of 5 stars","","4","Triple Black"
"R4JURXXGJGXGV","rob","After using the Sony WF-XM4's and Airpods Pro buds, I finally found the Bose QC Earbuds to be the most comfortable for my ears. Seems I have funny ears that don't like earbuds too much but seem to manage fine with these - most likely because they mainly sit outside the ear canal.Sound: After years of Sony WH-XM3's, I was originally offended by the sound of these and was considering returning before I found a decent setting on the EQ built into the Bose app. Out of the box, mids are heavily pronounced which some people might like. I found the best EQ profile to be Bass +6, Mid -5 and Treble +7.Controls: The touch controls generally work well and the ability to change the volume from the earbuds is great (crazy enough, this was not available without a firmware update so looks like a later addition for Bose). The key annoyance is that there is no default control for skipping back and forward between tracks. You can set the shortcut key (long press on left bud) to be among other things skip back or skip forward but you can't have both. Not the end of the world but a shame this could not be catered for.Case/Charging: The case is bigger than some others but durable and can still go in a pocket but it will stick out a bit. The case has a handy LED indicator to show how much charge is left in the case itself. USB-C charging is also great.Bugs, bugs, bugs: The biggest problem I've had is the bugs in the firmware/software on these. My first pair had to be replaced by Bose as they somehow stopped going into pairing mode and it was impossible to reset them (Bose were supportive although you can go up to 3 weeks without earbuds during the replacement process – I waited a week and a half). The pair I have now work but have a few issues which I feel won't be solved by another replacement:1) Connecting to devices is painful – to switch between devices, you have to use the button on the case which is a pain but would be bearable if it worked properly. Each time the button is pressed, you have to wait a couple of seconds for the buds to start announcing what device it will try to connect to. Sometimes the button just stops responding and I have to put the buds back in the case, close it for 5 seconds and take them out again. Sometimes (less common) a device connects and then suddenly the connection drops and I have to reconnect again. Sometimes pressing the button, immediately you get a message that the connection failed and then it connects just fine. All in all, it works fine 80% of the time, but the 20% is a pain in the butt.2) Stolen connections – this might not be the fault of the buds, but some of my devices steal the Bluetooth connection from others, e.g. I’ll be listening to music via my phone, will switch on my laptop and then the laptop steals the connection (even though nothing is playing on it). This doesn’t happen with my Sony’s but they are older so that might be why.3) Noise-cancelling – in general this is fine but there are a couple of issues. Some sounds are picked up by the mic’s and played back in a way that is unpleasant for the ears, e.g. crushing a plastic bottle created a popping-like sound which makes me cringe a bit. Also, sometimes when then buds are in aware (ambient) mode, some noises seem to cause heavier noise cancelling to kick in, e.g. clicking my fingers causes the buds to dull the ambient noise for a second before returning to normal ambient. Not sure if this is a feature or a bug.5) General bugs – This only happened once, but I was listening to some music and then all of a sudden the sound went crackly and I could not resolve this issue without resetting the buds and having to pair all devices againAll in all, when the bugs are not present, I would give these 4 out of 5, but with the bugs it takes the experience down at least 1 star.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 March 2022","Comfortable but quite buggy","3.0 out of 5 stars","","25","Triple Black"
"R1K425DOMXH1D7","Courte Jester","Owning both the old QC15 and QC25 over-the-air models, I was expecting better.Yes, these earbuds have better sound reproduction and (marginally) better noise cancelling than my AirPod Pro's, but they're some distance from the noise cancelling on the old QC15/QC25 over-the-ears. I tested all three ear fit options with only marginal differences in noise cancelling and settled on the 2+ size as the best fit for my ears. It must mean I've got Orc ears or something. I blame mum.I'll keep these Bose ear buds and they'll get some use as an alternate/back-up to the AirPod Pro's, but when I'm going on the plane or am in a situation when I want decent noise cancelling, I'll definitely be bringing the old over-the-ear models. They've yet to be beat by any other model or brand, plus it's nice to have the old school option along the lines of ""Oops, ran out of battery on a 16 hour flight...guess I'll just pop in a spare AA battery"" rather than doing the ""Oh bugger, now I'll have to listen to a screaming child for an hour while I do a Not-So-Quick-Charge"" and subtlety ask the flight attendant for three wee bottles of scotch and whether she could slip another one to that kid?Regarding the app, no issues there in terms of set-up or functionality, and was able to quickly set up other Bluetooth sources (in addition to my iPhone and iPad, I also utilize an Airfly for creating a Bluetooth output from my Denon amp and bedroom telly).Tip for people like me who can't resist generally buggering around with things, I ended up using the same trick I used with my AirPod Pro's to get a little better fit for noise cancelling. It found with AirPod Pros and with these Bose Ear Buds that the ear-tip fit thingy's plastic is a little too pliable and could do with having a bit more resistance:- using a pair of sharp scissors, I cut the narrower end off a pair of foam ear plugs (about 1cm or so...or about god knows what in Imperial measurements. Imperial lost me at '4 groats equals 1 scrotum').- using a leather punch (you know the ones, look like a pair of scissors but with a wheelie-thing housing different sized punches to create different sized holes), I punched out a hole down the centre of the foam tip.- scrunch up the narrower end of the ear tip fitter things that come with the ear buds and shove it through the hole in the foam ear plug pieces and fold back down. In a nutshell, this is basically just getting ear plug foam underneath the plastic bit that sits in your ear to give a bit of resistance.- For me at least, just having that extra bit of push from the foam ear plug pieces up against the business end of the ear bud plastic makes a bit of a difference in terms of a seal. I'm sure both the Apple overlords and Boseans have tested their ear tip creations and swear up, down and sideways that we're living the dream in terms of their ear-fit technology, but whether my ears lost out in the chromosome wars or no-one actually thought of a bit of pushy foam doing the trick, it works for me. There, done. Now, go make a cuppa and carry on thinking about your life choices.","Reviewed in Canada on 17 July 2022","Meh, with an aftertaste of 'disappointing' and hint of 'can't be buggered sending 'em back'","3.0 out of 5 stars","","18","Soapstone"
"R34WZMR7HPBC3Z","Mandy Lou","These buds cancel ANY+ALL noises out, 100%. They sound AH-MAZING! Super comfy! Despite the way they “look like they would feel” in your ears. Especially compared in size to 🍎 and Beats Buds. If you are not worried about the seamless connection ((such as connecting automatically, or reconnecting automatically after you walk out of range from your device while using the buds, as well as having to try several times to connect them through either the device’s Bluetooth settings, or if you are forced to connect them through the Bose app, this gets very frustrating because Bose has a total of THREE APPS. It doesn’t say which of those is ACTUALLY the preferred and up to date app. But I believe ATLEAST two of the apps recommend you downloading the newer version. And it doesn’t state which is preferred. So when you are forced to connect through Bose app because of connectivity failure, you feel unsure if you are in the correct app so you attempt several times in each app)) By that time, you are pissed off and DETERMINED to MAKE them connect someway. So it turns to a vicious cycle. Then once connected… God forbid you forget about the hell you went through to successfully connect them and run out in a desperate attempt to NOT pee your pants and step out of range! Because they are not going to give you that once annoying— but NOW HEAVENLY reconnect sound that AirPods give you after returning back to range letting you know that they have reconnected AUTOMATICALLY to your device!  That noise used to irritate me when I had AirPods. I found myself yearning for that sound to fill my ears after ditching all 5 pairs of AirPods to family members and friends that mentioned they wanted some AirPods or needed AirPods. (Part of me just wanted to break all of the “Indian giving” rules that my Mama taught me not to ever do. 🥴🥴Another great thing about the Bose QuietComfort ear buds is that the charging case is substantially larger in size. Most probably wouldn’t prefer the charging case to be any bigger than Apple Airpod cases. But I was FOREVER losing my AirPods. And forever having the hardest time locations and actually finding them. But I have had the Bose for TWO MONTHS. You would not believe that my B-U-double-T never misplaced them, never lost them, never had to search for them. NOT ONE SINGLE TIME. I believe that the size of the earbuds them self had much to do with not losing the individual earbuds— and the charging case being 3X’s the size of any AirPods.If  you could careless about that seamlessness connection between Apple products or Apple and newer Beats, then these ARE amazing. They sound great. You can not even feel them in your ears after the first hour or two. They just suck you right into the music because the noise cancellation is so powerful … your request is Bose’s demand. They are pretty amazing when it comes to those things. It’s the  mood for me, that I get in after spending an unsuccessful 30 minutes trying to connect some buds that decide that they are going to make me out to be a liar. Then suddenly, later on connecting MAYBE once with no issues. When you are not in a hurry or need them intensely. When you are laying around or going to sleep… they don’t give you an issue. It happened to me only when I needed them most. That’s how it ALL is though, AMM-I right?This may not be the case when you have an Android or Samsung or LG or Google phone. But it is definately a very well known issue with Apple devices. It just got extremely old. Extremely quick. So.. I now have a pair of Beats Pro ordered since they have the Apple M1 chip built in.","Reviewed in the United States on 2 October 2022","These are honestly the best sounding ear buds I have ever used when it comes to sound performance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","","12","Soapstone"
"R1VRD9DAL1QM75","Jo","Fidèle à Bose depuis des années et à son exceptionnelle réduction de bruit (j’avais le casque filaire, puis Blutooth), j’attendais d’avoir enfin des écouteurs intra-auriculaires a réduction de bruit pour investir à nouveau (environ) 300€ pour un format plus discret et « transportable ».Le gros plus est la qualité de la réduction de bruit (pour avoir essayé de nombreuses marques, c’est indéniablement LE gros point fort de Bose!). De ce côté là, pas de déception.A première vue, je trouve les écouteurs un peu trop imposants, mais la technologie demande sûrement cette taille d’écouteurs...ce qui est déjà une prouesse mais je suis certaine que cette taille réduira dans quelques années.Et au final, ces écouteurs sont assez légers, et les embouts sont bien conçus pour la stabilité et isoler du bruit.Par contre, grosse déception: PAS DE RÉGLAGE DU VOLUME DIRECTEMENT SUR LES ÉCOUTEURS. Il vous faudra passer par l’option « assistant vocal » pour monter ou baisser le son via votre smartphone. Donc si vous voulez modifier le volume, tout le monde entendra vos directives...pas génial...Pourquoi proposer l’option « vérification de la batterie » comme seule commande alternative avec l’avance ou le recul sur vôtre playlist??? Pourquoi ne pas l’annoncer lors de la connexion comme pour l’équivalent en casque fermé Bluetooth??? Cette option aurait pu être remplacée par le volume...mais da obligerait choisir entre réglage du volume OU de la sélection des morceaux...la encore, bof bof...Autre gros point noir, il faut déconnecter le Bluetooth de l’iPhone pour passer à celui de l’iPad au lieu de basculer lorsque le son est éteint sur l’iPhone et que celui de l’iPad démarre comme mon casque QuietComfort35: donc un gros manque de fluidité à ce niveau là aussi...J’avoue ne pas comprendre le bouton de connexion Bluetooth sur le boîtier et pas l’un des écouteurs??? Manifestement, les concepteurs ont du faire des choix pour que ceux ci ne soient pas aussi gros que des balles de ping-pong. Mais ça, ça peut éventuellement passer...Autre problème, je trouve que les écouteurs se sont déchargés super vite!!!À pleine charge lors de l’ouverture, quelques minutes à écouter de la musique, je les remets dans le boîtier jusqu’à ce soir et bam, plus de batterie au bout de 30 secondes alors que les voyants du boîtier étaient à 3/4 lors de l’ouverture, ils ne sont plus qu’à 1/4 quand je remets mes écouteurs pour les charger. Et le boîtier s’est éteint en quelques secondes et la..il charge...bof bof...Dernier point par top: le boîtier marque vite les traces de doigts et l’ouverture doit être faite à 2 mains car le bouton est un peu difficile à ouvrir...dommage...Ça fait beaucoup de « bof » pour un appareil à 280€!Le son est très bon (même si je trouve les basses un peu trop présentes), la réduction de bruit est fidèle à Bose, MAIS on sent qu’ils ont voulu sortir un modèle intra auriculaire avant Noël, quitte à « bâcler » certains aspects essentiels: réglage du volume, batterie fiable, fluidité de connexion Bluetooth...Je pense attendre que Bose améliore ce produit et me contenter d’autres écouteurs intra-auriculaires d’ici là, certes moins performants en terme de qualité de son ou de réduction de bruit, mais offrant plus de confort ergonomique et moins chers...","Reviewed in France on 22 June 2021","Beaucoup de déceptions pour 280€","3.0 out of 5 stars","","4","Triple Black"
"RB5RBOCF68RDG","Fabrizio","Buongiorno a tutti….Vengo subito al dunque….Non sono un esperto in auricolari, suono ecc ecc ma posso dirvi dopo aver acquistato e provato questi auricolari della Bose ( QuietConfort Earbuds ) che non valgono i soldi spesi.Li ho trovati in offerta quì su Amazon a 249 euro.Non valgono quella cifra perché in primis, nonostante abbiano in confezione diversi tipi e misure di gommini da poter adattare al proprio orecchio, a me continuano a cadere, reggono un pó ma appena faccio un movimento brusco con il corpo, cadono.Durata della batteria: Dopo due ore di ascolto si sono scaricate, credevo dopo aver letto diverse recensioni che durassero molto di più.Ho delle cuffie della Beats pagate 5 anni fa 300 euro che durano molto ma molto di più. Le davano per 20 ore consecutive ma in realtà durano 15/16 ore che non é male.Queste mi sono durate due ore :(L’audio non é male ma credevo avessero dei bassi più corposi…La cancellazione del rumore é ok ma solo in alcuni ambienti. Ad esempio dove lavoro io ( carpenteria pesante ) visto che c’é tantissimo rumore, quando le uso non percepisco questa riduzione tanto esaltata.Per quel che mi riguarda, non valgono più di 150 euro…Me le tengo perché non ho voglia di sbattermi a fare resi e poi cercarne altre.Ho speso 249 euro per un prodotto che sinceramente pensavo fosse meglio ma va bene lo stesso.Detto questo non mi prolungo e vi saluto a tutti sperando che queste due righe scritte vi possano essere d’aiuto.Ps: non ho scritto nulla sulla custodia e sulla sua capienza di ricarica perché per me le cose importanti erano quelle scritte sopra…. Il resto é noia :)Aggiornamento del 25 Marzo 2023Purtroppo a distanza di un anno dall’acquisto le ho dovute ridare indietro perché gracchiavano a volumi medio alto.Grande Amazon per l’assistenza data ai propri clienti, in brevissimo tempo mi hanno rimborsato l’intero importo senza farmi domande sul problema degli auricolari. Non mi aspettavo un rimborso a distanza di un anno dall’acquisto, ero convinto di doverli fare riparare e invece mi hanno ridato indietro i soldi….wow. Avevo anche la possibilità di sostituirli con un prodotto Bose più recente senza aggiungere soldi ma sinceramente dopo l’esperienza avuta non ne volevo più sapere di avere a che fare ancora con Bose.Mi hanno deluso in tutto e per tutto anche esteticamente parlando…..sono proprio brutti da vedere questi auricolari, me lo hanno detto tutti gli amici e colleghi di lavoro.Non ne sono ancora sicuro ma se comprerò altri auricolari o cuffie, passeró dalla concorrenza tipo Sony, Apple ecc ecc","Reviewed in Italy on 30 January 2022","Prezzo troppo alto!","3.0 out of 5 stars","","4","Triple Black"
"RRIEVLYTGDOLU","E. B.","Size:These things are gargantuan. The product photos are either photo-shopped to make them look smaller, or they intentionally found models with gigantic heads. These earbuds are enormous and heavy. No joke.Sound:The sound is fantastic. If you are an ""audiophile"" (AKA super, duper nit-picky about sound profiles far, far past the point that it actually matters in any way), you might find some faults here. They sound great. End of story.Active Noise Cancelling (ANC):Fantastic.I haven't tried all the earbuds out there. Trying these alongside my Airpods Pro, the Bose cancel far, FAR more noise. I work next to a loud air conditioner. Although I can still hear it running 5 ft away. I can only BARELY hear it. ANC is great!Features:Before buying these I read the forums raging about the terrible touch controls and lack of software features. I almost didn't purchase these because of the issue noted there. However, I am glad to report that the firmware and software updates have (mostly) solved most of these issues.1) You CAN skip tracks backward now. However, to do so, you need to set a custom ""shortcut"" touch control. You get either skip-forward OR skip-back, not both. You can select only one. The lack of simple skip forward or back controls baffles my mind. My $19 MPOW earbuds do this, and I think so do nearly every other earbuds on the planet. But at least we can finally skip backward now.2) Volume controls work well. I have no problem using the volume controls, and I never accidentally activate voice assistant while doing so (although I accidentally activate voice assistant for other reasons all the time, see below)3) You still cannot turn off voice assistant, and it will try to bud-dial your contacts if you let it. A long press on the right bud brings up the native voice assistant on your phone (Bixby for me, yuck). You cannot deactivate this feature. You WILL activate voice assistant holding these in your hand, or trying to pick them up from on a table. This is awful. Make it stop!Fit:Deal-breaker! (for me)The only real deal breaker here is that the ear tips DO NOT stay in my ears. By all the positive reviews, I assume these work fine for most people. I have very normal looking ears. The 'bud' portion of the tip doesn't actually stick into your ear canal. It is supposed to push against the opening, and remain there secured by the wings. That means if your ear geometry isn't exactly what the Bose engineers anticipated, the wings don't work, and the earbuds don't stay put. They fall out when casually walking around the store. Yes, I followed the instruction video. Yes, I tried all the sizes. Yes, I tried to get used to them for several days. No, they do not work. Not even a little.Many people have this problem. When they contact Bose on their forum (I haven't tried), Bose is kind enough to point them to the video that plays by default when you install the app, and tell them to try all the different ear tip sizes. That is their only response, even if the customer states that they already did this. I don't think Bose even reads these comments any more, because they can't fix it. Look at your ears in the mirror to decide if you think these will work, or just roll the dice and try 'em.Overall:These are really big. But they also sound great. But they are huge. But they have great ANC. But they fall out of my ears walking around.","Reviewed in the United States on 12 July 2021","Great ANC, Great sound. Unusable as they don't stay in my ears.

"R2778EW0JXCLMP","B.H","I thought I had finally got near replacing my QC20s. As good as they are I hate being wired as it is very restricting and the previous bose wireless just look ridiculous or have other major drawbacks.The new bose earbuds address all that and make some improvements but in some ways are also a step back.First of all the comfort, the QC20 have great comfort levels and the new buds are comfortable as well but not quite as comfortable. They are bulkier and after prolonged use you certainly feel them more, they also dont sit quite so nice in the ear. The weight on them is just a tad too much to make them great for working out either. It can be done but I found myself adjusting them all the time even with light exercise. Still think bose are ahead of the game with their in but on ear designs which dont go too deep into the ear and just rest on the inner ear.The sound. This is one area where there has been an improvement its improved from the QC20 and there is some good detail now within the music and overall tone is very good, however, these are far from audiophile listening, they just sound good.The noise cancellation. This has also improved and I would say the 80-90% setting on the new earbuds is where the old QC20 are at with total noise restriction. It's not a massive improvement but it is a bit extra when you notch it up that extra 10% it does quieten the world a little more. But the 80-90 on the old ones is quite good as it was but improvements are always welcome. What is nice is the customisation where you can set it to exactly what you want on the new ones from 0 to 100 in 10% increments.The new buds have an app also which lets you control some features but no eq to change sound presentations just features and the noise cancellation. I also found the app a little buggy, lots of the time it wouldnt connect easily but needed repeated attempts, and I have a 2020 android top of the range phone.In conclusion its a mix of good and bad unfortunately. The wireless is amazing, the bulkiness is not even though they are getting there with that. The sound improvement is good and so is the noise cancelling. But overall for me I still don't think its enough for me to move on from my QC20s just yet, its a shame as I really want to go wireless.

"R2YBD4M3Y57FP3","Oscar","Just for some background, I live with headphones in my ear for the majority of the day, so I knew I would put it through it's paces once I got it. Before these, I was strictly using airpods. But after my second pair in 2 years, it was starting to drag on me that I would have to replace the ones I currently had. Then a friend of mine recommended these and let me try his. From the moment I tried out the noise cancelling, I was sold. Sadly the feeling didn't last. The first pair I had died within a week. I used them a few times and then they stopped connecting to the phone before just outright never charging. I returned them and ordered a second pair because I thought maybe the first one was fluke as my wife and friend did not have that same issue. The second pair thankfully is still working though I do have connections issues from time.Pros:- The sound quality is on par if not better than the air pods I had.- When the noise cancellation is active, it really does drown out the background noise. Which is nice when I walk my dogs as is drowns out the noise of the busy street.- The shortcuts that allow me to adjust the noise cancellation level just by touching the headphones is also a great feature.- Battery life is also good as I'm only really charging the headphones once a week.Cons:- My biggest complaint is the microphone. I've given up on ever answering the phone with these headphones on. I don't know if it's because of the noise cancelling or what, but everyone I speak to complains that they can hear all of the background noise more than they can hear. I've tried trouble shooting and  adjusting the noise cancelling levels but still nothing changes.- The next issue I've had is with the fit. At first it was fine, but now I find that when I put the headphones in my ear, I keep having to adjust it because if the fit is wrong then I get a whistling sound coming through. It can get really annoying and also hurts because the adjustment causes a loud high pitch squeal until I find the right fit.Overall, the ear buds are good and for my day to day I find them to be good. But the fact that I keep having issues with the fit, where the only solution is to buy new rubber fittings, and the fact that the microphone just doesn't work right, keeps me from giving it a higher rating.","Reviewed in the United States on 11 June 2022","I would rate these a little higher if it weren't for the microphone...","3.0 out of 5 stars","","3","Triple Black"
"RDPE09S485B91","Sonnenblumenkerne","Kurz und knapp zu meinen persönlichen Eindrücken. Ich bin Quiet Comfort 20 User seit 2013 und habe seitdem vielleicht 10-15 Stück besessen. Zumeist immer 2 im Einsatz. Viele davon sind irgendwie kaputt gegangen. Aber für mich sind es trotzdem ganz besondere Kopfhörer, auf die ich (immer noch) nicht verzichten will.- Klang: Der Klang ist gut. Wie gut, kann ich nicht sagen. Aber gut auf jeden Fall. Dadurch, dass kein Kabel dran hängt, ist der Klang auch klarer, vor allem bei Bewegung. Schließlich übertragen die Kabel Schall. Und mir ist noch aufgefallen, dass die Earbuds deutlich weniger windempfindlich sind. Bei den QC20 löst schon der leiseste Windhauch massiv störende Geräusche aus, so dass man es entweder bleiben lässt oder eine Mütze aufzieht. Die Earbuds haben das nicht. Bei leichtem Wind kann man sie sehr gut nutzen. Wenn es etwas mehr ist, wird das leider auch hörbar, aber es ist dann immerhin nicht ganz so scharf und störend.- ANC: Das ist ganz gut aber das hat ein bestimmtes Frequenzprofil, das ich nicht raushören kann. Ich würde die Earbuds irgendwo zwischen den Airpods Pro und QC20 ansiedeln. In manchen Situationen sehr gut, in anderen eher suboptimal.  Alles, was mit Maschinenlärm zu tun hat, finde ich nicht so toll gedämpft. Aber für Innenräume, auch Züge oder das Flugzeug innen, wo man nicht so arg laute, tieftönige Motorengeräusche hört, denke ich, sind sie sehr gut geeignet.- Tragekomfort: Eigentlich super. Habe nach ein paar Stunden aber trotzdem komische Schmerzen im Ohr bekommen. Bei den QC20 war das noch nie der Fall, auch nicht nach 8 oder 10 Stunden.- Sitz: Schwierig. Auf Anhieb bekomme ich die Dinger nicht passgenau ins Ohr rein. Aber nach einer Weile klappt es dann schon. Die Hörer beim QC20 sitzen bei mir 100% perfekt ein, immer und auf Anhieb. Da muss man nichts drehen oder nachbessern, höchstens minimal. Ist bei den Earbuds aber nicht so.- Nutzung: Ohne App und Internet sind diese Teile scheinbar nur sehr eingeschränkt nutzbar - immerhin doch ein Elektroschrott. Um sämtliche Einstellungen vornehmen zu können, muss man die App nutzen, muss sich registrieren, muss sich anmelden und die Hörer aktivieren. Aktivieren! Beim ersten Versuch hat das bei mir nicht geklappt, mit Fehlermeldung. Ich habe gedacht, ohje. Was soll das denn jetzt? Und die Teile müssen für jedes Gerät seprarat aktiviert werden. Das bedeutet, wenn die BOSE Server irgendwann mal nicht mehr diesen Aktivierungsdienst verrichten, sind die Dinger wirklich nur noch sehr eingeschränkt brauchbar. In 10 Jahren könnte das durchaus der Fall sein. Sicher, das ist eine lange Zeit, irgendwie. Aber 10 Jahre oder vielleicht 15 oder 20 sind auch mal rum. Und dann? Finde ich grundsätzlich ziemlich fragwürdig, was BOSE da macht. Warum eigentlich? Was ergibt das für einen Sinn? Wo liegt der Nutzen?- Akkulaufzeit: Ohne Musik, nur ANC auf höchster Stufe halten sie bei mir 10 Stunden. Das ist vergleichbar mit den QC20. Also sehr gut.- Verarbeitung macht aber einen sehr guten Eindruck.- Steuerung: Gefällt mir nicht. Ich erspare mir die Fummelei und mache alles über meinen iPod oder das iPhone.Was mir auch nicht gefällt, was aber oft der Fall ist, dass man nicht nur einen Hörer einzeln nutzen kann. Aber man kann immerhin die ganze ""Trageerkennung"" deaktivieren, so dass man dann auch einen einzeln nutzen kann, der andere allerdings in Funkweite und aktiv sein muss.Was das ""Grundrauschen"" betrifft, das ist natürlich bei jedem Exemplar anders. Kennt man von den anderen ANC Geräten. Das ist Glückssache. Manche rauschen kaum, andere ziemlich stark. Mir ist noch aufgefallen, wenn man mit den Fingern die Earbuds berührt zwecks Steuerung, verursacht das relativ laute, unangenehme Geräusche.- Fazit:Wenn man über Registrierung, Aktivierung, Steuerung hinweg sieht und sie gut an die richtige Stelle setzen kann, wo sie dann auch abschließen, wie es vorgesehen ist. Und wenn man keine Schmerzen davon bekommt. Und wenn man ein rauscharmes Exemplar erwischt - oder entspannt mit einem Grundrauschen umgehen kann. Dann würde ich sagen, die Earbuds sind keine schlechte Wahl. Der Klang ist super und dürfte die meisten zufriedenstellen. Akkulaufzeit auch prima. ANC könnte besser sein, ist aber in vielen Situationen mit Sicherheit mehr als zufriedenstellend.- Ansonsten würde ich aber sagen, dass man die Earbuds wirklich ausprobieren muss, vor allem im Alltag, wo sie dann eingesetzt werden. Den Preis finde ich dann doch etwas übertrieben. Für mich sind sie leider nichts, die QC20 passen viel besser zu mir. Trotz Kabelei und all den Qualitätsproblemen.","Reviewed in Germany on 9 October 2020","Gemischte Gefühle nach dem ersten Tag","3.0 out of 5 stars","","53","Triple Black"
"R3CDCBRR5550G8","Jack","TLDR: These earbuds are a great selection with great sound quality and superb battery life. Noise cancellation is below par. If you want to only use one earbud at a time, it cannot be the left one.Long-winded review:I have been a long-time user of Bose. And these earbuds are a great option for most people.Pros: These earbuds have a great sound. Bass is good, as is the depth and quality of the overall output. They have a respectable battery life on their own, that is lengthened tremendously when paired with the case; it is easy to charge the case once a week and not much more. It’s hard to beat Bose’s construction and quality; these earbuds fit well (especially considering the range of earpiece sizes you can swap out) and take a long time to get uncomfortable, something I think is a great quality (I have mine in for >5 hours at a time and they don’t bother me).Cons: My main problem with these earbuds is the noise cancellation. Via the Bose app, you have the option of selecting how much ambient sound you want to eliminate from your audio. When indoors in an office environment, I have found this more than sufficient. However, when outside this feature breaks down. It does nothing to cancel wind noise, indeed, having these earbuds in when it’s windy makes the problem worse. I cannot use my earbuds outside when it’s even as low as a 3mph wind because all I’ll hear in my audio is wind. If you don’t exercise outside, walk with them, or otherwise won’t be using them outdoors, you’ll likely have no problems. The only other con I have to mention is minor: you cannot use just the left earbud. You can use the right earbud by itself and walk away from the case, and all will work fine. This is not true of the left earbud. If you pop in only the left earbud and close the case, the earbud disconnects. Kind of annoying but I don’t suppose it’s a major issue. I am mostly deaf in my left ear, so I don’t really need to use it anyway, but someone with the opposite problem, who cannot hear well out of their right ear would likely find this to be a major issue.","Reviewed in the United States on 18 January 2023","Great sound, not for outdoors","3.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Triple Black"
"R1HW95G56E2CQT","AVBHPDX","Perhaps I could give this a higher star review and a word of caution.  First, these are amazing, comfortable, secure and the noise cancelling is really impressive.  I think if you're in a quite to moderate sound environments you'll love these--I did.Second, after repeating exposure to the noise cancelling mode in a structured and careful way I can say my experience using them with loud noises is convincing that these ear buds caused and now provoke my tinnitus on each reattempt.  I used these with a lot of power tools around the house every few weeks for about 6 months (mower, leaf blower, trimmer, circular saw, other saws, impact driver).  I list all of these tools specifically because I noticed that in the noise cancelling mode with each of these I developed onset of tinnitus (something I've never dealt with before when using normal ear protection).  When using these tools and noise cancelling mode I would occasionally get a sudden, nearly painful constructive interference with abrupt onset that stops within 1 to 3 seconds that I perceived as equal or louder than the noise I was trying to cancel out. With a circular saw (very loud tool) the loud sound in the earbuds would go much longer than 3 seconds (almost like a very loud crackling sound as long as the saw was being used).  I've googled this question of noise cancelling technology provoking tinnitus multiple times, but haven't found much to support an association.  Not sure if I'm unique, this was random failure of my specific device, inappropriate use of the technology by me, or I was more prone because of history of tools use (however, I'm really strict about my ear protection and that was my motivation to get these ear buds).  I've carefully repeated multiple experiments of exposure with these buds in noise cancelling mode trying to convince myself they are safe for me to use (because I love them!), but instead undeniably they are the problem.  Hope this is not happening to others.  Tinnitus is complex (see Ringing in the brain, Josef Rauschecker, TECx 1/23/2017), and little to nothing appears reported on an association with noise cancelling tech, so I'm assuming someone's risk without tools is little to none, though given my experience I have to believe there is risk to others with louder noise/tools/etc.  I'm mainly writing this review so that if others have this problem and search for ringing in the ears or tinnitus more might become clear whether this product or other noise cancelling technologies could be an avoidable exacerbating factor for tinnitus.","Reviewed in the United States on 7 August 2021","AVOID power tools/very loud sounds, tinnitus (ringing in ears)","3.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Soapstone"

It's real and honest.","Do you like having to mess around with ur ears and tap on them while readjusting the volume and opening up an app to make sure its on loudest so you never open it again?  Do you like making sure the tip is fully in even though you barely feel it?  If you do then this is for you.This is such a frustrating out of the box experience that when I tried to impress a woman with it who was interested in both me and the earbuds I looked stupid because of the pre-setup and that's on you with your bad technology blue balling BOSE.I had to spend like two hours customizing and messing with the in-ear, out-ear, volume tap, Spotify app, update this, close that, only works in case here shenanigans just to get it to be a good base experience.  The volume control is still terrible.  It constantly will think its a double tap and pause your song and if your working out that's not optimal and its annoying as hell.  Spotify app will bug out and play absolutely random playlist entirely if you aren't careful, yes its updated you have to in order to even use it out the box.Why the hell can't I just use the earbuds and pop them in my ear and not worry about anything other than volume and song select?  Shameful shipping state.  I can't even believe these are on sale down from 280$+.  Who the hell is paying that? DON'T!  200$ might be ok if you aren't picky and sort through problems on a daily basis anyway but be aware you are gonna fiddle with this device no matter how experienced you think you are with technology, I promise.  They messed up that bad.Great sound, frustrating tech, clearly untested by people with unbiased opinions of their app because its garbage and you will have to fiddle with these buds.  I love your Soundsports because they work just fine.  I wish they had louder audio so I didn't buy these to begin with but here we are.

"R3VTA1870PFRK4","David S.","Based on my research I had such high hopes for these earbuds.  But, after having used them for a month, while sound quality and noise cancelling are excellent, overall I am disappointed.I would assume that part of what allows them to perform so well is that they are larger than many of their competitors.  Unfortunately, because of that size (and associated weight), I can only wear them for about an hour before I have to take them out because they get unbearably uncomfortable.But, the biggest disappointment is the exceptionally limited touch functionality, combined with horrible customer service.Not only do these earbuds lack the full range of common touch controls, but even the limited functions available do not work - most notably the ability to skip forward.  It appears that you can configure the touch control in the app to allow you to skip, rather than annunciate battery level, but when you change it in the app, it still only announces the battery level.  This issue is well documented in the Bose community forums.  When I contacted Bose customer support via chat, I was first forced to attempt a firmware update - via my PC - even though I had already confirmed that the firmware was current via the app.  When I asked the chat agent why I had to use the PC, when the app had the ability to check / update the firmware, and what would happen if I didn't have a PC, I got no reasonable answer.  After confirming that the firmware was in fact current, the only option the agent would give me was to replace the earbuds.  From reading the posts on the community, I already knew that many had tried this option, only to discover that it didn't solve the problem.  It seems obvious to me that this is an issue with the app and/or the firmware, but the Bose support agent would not acknowledge this.  When I requested that I be transferred to 2nd level support, the agent said she would document my concern, but would not transfer me and again offered to send me a replacement.Given the premium price that comes with these earbuds, I would have expected better from Bose.I would have returned these, but unfortunately, I waited too long to complete my evaluation and the return window closed.","Reviewed in the United States on 13 July 2021","Noise cancelation and sound are great, touch controls and Bose support are severely lacking.","3.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Triple Black"

"R2DCFHTWNYFJ27","Eugene Swank","I have had the opportunity to use these earbuds on four aircraft flights. The noise cancellation is fantastic. They make it possible to enjoy music while flying without having the volume at high levels. I didn't expect it but it is also easier to hear announcements from the flight crew. I bought these specifically for the noise cancellation when I travel and I am very pleased with these. Once connected (see below) the sound is great. Balanced and clear.Some people don't like the size of the case saying it is too big. It probably is a little too big to put in your pocket but I typically have the case in a backpack with other electronics.Some also think these are too big. I can't see them when I'm wearing them and they are very comfortable so I almost forget I have them in. The way the compliant earpieces hold onto the inside of my ear and how they don't insert into the ear canal but seal against it makes these very comfortable and secure.The reason I don't give these 5 stars is due to the horrible Bose software. I have an iPhone 8 and iPad 6th generation and have had no issues whatsoever connecting to any device through Bluetooth. This goes for external speakers, car receivers, or other Bluetooth headsets. The first time I used them they tried to do a firmware update which kept failing. Eventually it worked. I have had to do a factory reset on the earbuds, uninstall-reinstall the Bose app, push the Bluetooth button on the case, turn Bluetooth on and off on my devices, hit retry, dismiss, and wait for a miracle to happen to actually be able to use these. This is with the earbuds and the case millimeters from the device. They will ""connect"" to the last device even if it is turned off. I don't mean the Bluetooth off I mean the device is off. The software must have no sort of communications check to verify the connection. I have not found any consistent way to switch from one device to the other. As an example I might want to watch a video on the iPad and later switch to the iPhone for music. A search of the Bose ""help"" and online has been of little use. The best I have found is to just pair them with one device and then stop. If Bose were to do a major update, e.g. 5.0, it may address these issues but for the price paid for these I am disappointed in the buggy, poorly thought out software.","Reviewed in the United States on 22 May 2021","The Bose earbuds are gold, the Bose software is pure garbage.","3.0 out of 5 stars","","2","Triple Black"
"R2TTO5QUVPFVVY","M. Fromin","I have had AirPods Pros since Oct 2019 and I purchased these in Oct 2020 so I have had 2 months to compare them head to head.Issue #1 - Getting a good eartip fitThe biggest issue I had with these was getting a comfortable fit while getting a solid seal.  If you don't have a solid seal the sound and noise cancelling suffer significantly.  The 2 size did not quite get a good seal and the 3 size felt like I was jamming a large item into my ears.  By comparison the AirPods pros silicone tips are less intrusive and (for me at least) created a good seal with no real ""pressure"" on the ear.Issue #2 - Charging case is LARGEI often take my AirPods Pros with me on the go so I can either listen to music or take calls as needed without having to hold the phone to my head for calls.  The size of the case for the Bose is easily double the size of the AirPods Pro.  It would be rather cumbersome to place that in your pocket.Issue #3 - Calls and only one earbud can be usedBose uses a master and slave approach to their product so you can only use one of them for calls.  By comparison the AirPods Pros allow me to use either bud for calls.  For long calls you can switch between them in case you run out of battery in either bud.Issue #4 - Touch controls are too sensitiveThe force sensor on the AirPods Pros are not hard to use but it is really hard to accidentally engage them.  By comparison I frequently accidentally caused the Bose to trigger the tap behavior when simply adjusting the bud in my ear.  Perhaps if I had a great seal I would never touch them but when I did it was too easy to trigger the behavior.As a PLUS for the Bose, you can adjust the volume via the touch controls - the AirPod Pros sadly cannot do that a year after release.Are the Bose bad earbuds - absolutely not!  If I did not have my AirPod Pros I would likely be pretty happy with these earbuds.  The sound (when the seal is right) is as good or better than any other option on the market.  The same can be said for the noise cancellation. Unfortunately if these don't fit your ears right they become really expensive average earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States on 21 December 2020","If they fit and you don't mind the weight these are on par with anything else on the market","3.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Triple Black"
"R2922EN4SV1HXB","BlueTurtle","Update: the technical issues continue to mount and Bose support is very lacking in this case. Connectivity to various devices are spotty and frustrating. My other Bluetooth devices have no such issues. Bose was once a leader in noise cancelling but as technologies evolve Bose will soon fall behind if they don’t address these kinds of issues.I need noise cancelling. Noise affects my mental health and I live in a very noisy area. I normally use Bose QC over ear head phones but they get hot after awhile and give me ear fatigue so I needed an in ear option. I also use Jabra Elite buds and lots of various ear plugs.The noise cancelling on these quiet comfort buds are incredible! Just one level lower than my over the ear headphones. This is what I bought them for and they deliver! Thus my 5 star rating.The sound is wonderful for mids and highs. Below average in regards to base and lows.The fit is average for my ears. Definitely look in the mirror when you fit them in so they go in the right spot. They begin to bother my ears around 30 minutes in, but this is the norm for me with ear buds that need a seal. The reason I’m keeping these is that you can adjust them slightly while keeping the seal, but alleviating the pressure point. This is not ideal but it is way better than any other earbuds I’ve tried and I have to live with the tech that’s available. With the adjustments I can push it to a few hours of wear time. I am hoping that my ears will also develop a tolerance over time.The extras are very lacking. I turned off the voice prompts because they are too loud. The buds will instead make a thumping sound to let me know when I’m connected to Bluetooth. This thumping is loud and annoying and there is no option to turn it off. Bose has acknowledged this issue but has yet to make any update (over a year since I saw in the forums). So what I do is wait until they connect, then I put them in my ears. They also can only connect to one device at a time so you have to manually disconnect before switching. The controls on the buds themselves are pretty much limited to changing noise cancelling levels and skipping forward one track.I totally understand why others would dock Bose stars for these shortcomings. They are annoying for sure. But for noise cancelling these are amazing and I’ll continue to bear the inconveniences in order to block out noise.","Reviewed in the United States on 5 January 2021","Supreme noise cancelling but technical shortcomings are aggravating","3.0 out of 5 stars","","2","Soapstone"
"R33II9BRLIOZ8C","Samantha","I've only been using these headphones for a couple of days, and as far as the hardware itself, I could not be happier:- they are *extremely* comfortable and rest snugly in my ears.  I had read reviews that the earpiece may cause discomfort over many hours of use, but that has not been the case for me (I had a very snug, comfortable fit with the ""2"" that was in place by default, and feel no need to switch it out)- the sound quality is fantastic.  I picked these up with the intention to use them on calls and audio scenarios where I need to clearly hear/understand people.  The audio is crystal clear for me, and the levels out of the box fit my needs nicely.- the noise cancelling is also fantastic.  I could virtually cancel out a person speaking directly at me from 3 feet away and almost hear no noise (at room-voice talking levels).  The controls on the left ear for tuning the ANC took a little getting used to, but are quite handy for switching noise-cancel settings when you need to hear things around you (I suppose you could just remove one earpiece and it'll do this automatically, but I have not had enough time to experiment with this further)HOWEVERThe phone app (in my case, Andriod, Bose Music per documentation's instructions) is hot garbage.  You will be required to use this if you want to customize buttons, sound settings, and firmware updates.  This is my only Bose product, and it had a hard time finding the headphones, continuing to recognize that the headphones were connected to my phone, and perform updates (had to attempt this multiple times in order for the update to complete).  I'm hoping that this is one of those ""set and forget"" scenarios, but the experience with the app was so terrible that I could see someone wanting to go look for something else.  TL;DR - get past the initial configuration + updates, and I think you'll be extremely pleased with these earbuds.

As a glasses wearer, overhead headphones give me a headache if I wear them too long (with the number of online meetings I attend this is usually the case by mid morning!). ANC earbuds seemed like the way to go and so, having researched a few different brands, I took the plunge and splurged the £249 for these.When first trying them, you had to pick me up off the floor - although a tad uncomfortable, the ANC was amazing & the sound quality was also excellent when playing music and videos on my phone. They didn't budge when exercising. Overall I was super impressed.Alas, it all seemed to go wrong on day 2.Not only was the noise cancellation hit and miss during the day, the sound quality on my calls left a lot to be desired. The volume control was tempermental at best. What was slight discomfort on day 1 had turned into a throbbing ache within 20 minutes of wearing them on Teams Meetings. I therefore swapped out the tips for the smaller set, hoping this would alleviate the pressure in my ears. It didn't. After wearing these for various meetings during the day, my ears were so painful that evening I couldn't even wear my old wired headphones.Having read some further reviews, it seems that the materials used for the tips is different to older models and this seems ro have had a big impact on the comfort this brand was previously renowned for.Having outlaid so much for them, I really truly wanted to like them but unfortunately they will be going back.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 July 2021","I really wanted to like these, but the pain was too much!","3.0 out of 5 stars","","18","Soapstone"

These have a little plastic loop that's intended to fit into the contours of your ear, but the buds are so big and heavy that it doesn't really work. If I'm exercising or even just bending over one of them will inevitably fall out.They do come with three different size loops, but none of them work for me.The places where you're supposed to touch them to control functions are very hard to locate and to get them to work. While installing the left one I'll invariably accidentally change listening mode, but then can't get it to switch back.As others have pointed out, the button to open the case is very annoying and hard to press.

"R2OUFMI1MUHIYE","manbsu","I have always compared Bose with Sony and viceversa because I believe these 2 brands are the best when it comes to headphones/earphones.I ordered the Bose Quietcomfort earbuds and I was impressed with the Noise cancelling they managed to pull off, I also liked the fact they're very comfortable and easy to fit in. But what was very disappointing for me was the SOUND (arguably the most important factor when purchasing earphones/earbuds etc.) specifically the low volume on these earbuds. I personally had to turn the volume up to around 80% to actually feel and enjoy the music. I just felt like the music didn't have any kick and you're not even able to tune the music inside the app.This has been a reoccurring issue with Bose products for me, for example the Bose QC 35II headphones, great ANC, extremely comfortable and lightweight, but the sound and volume of the sound were very poor for a premium product that costs hundreds of pounds.On the other hand the Sony wf-1000xm4 have good NC technology, they're not as comfortable (at least for me, and they are more difficult to fit in) but the SOUND is stellar in my opinion, loud, punchy, vibrant and invigorating. You can fully enjoy the music at 50% volume.If somehow Bose could manage to achieve this level of quality of sound from Sony they would have the best earbuds on the market by far.Or maybe Sony can make their earbuds more comfortable and improve their ANC a little bit, either way I would be a 100% happy customer.For now I'm still waiting for the best headphones/earbuds to be released...","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 September 2021","Fantastic NC, comfortable earplugs, but poor sound","3.0 out of 5 stars","","19","Triple Black"
"R26FT5ZFUDH95R","4$|-|","I had been waiting for Bose truly wireless earbuds since last year. I was super excited when I learned that they are now released. Below are some pros and cons I discovered while my 2 week use. Note: that this is my personal opinion and your experience might be different.Pros: -Impeccable sound quality- Best in class noise cancellation- Both sides have sensors; meaning the music will stop/pause when you take out either side from your ear and play back when you put them on again.- Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity, maintains the 30ft connectivity- Secure fit (depends)Cons:- Bulky and heavy. Yes they are heavier than Airpods Pro or even their sibling Bose Sport Earbuds. Speaking of the weight, while the tips help in maintaining the secure fit, they didn’t work well for running or working out.- Lack of basic controls(mute, volume), and, to my surprise it wasn’t configurable either. I would have expected Bose to allow them to be configurable. More details in Suggestion section.- cannot use left earbud for calls (you can do that on AirPods Pro)- need to learn how to put the earbuds on. Mine would fall off immediately until I discovered “how to wear” in the help section of the app.I will be returning these as they lack comfort due to weight, secure fit (won’t stay in while running) and lack of on board controls, which are essential for me.Suggested Updates:I might have kept these if Bose had allowed configurable gesture controls. For instance: The default control set up from Bose music app allows music controls on the right earbuds and cycling through predefined noise cancellation levels on the left. While that’s useful, I don’t believe a lot of users would be cycling through noise cancellation as much as other basic controls especially  during the new normal, wfh scenarios. It would be nice if Bose would allow the three favorite levels to be configurable, where these 3 options provided a list of user configurable options; mute, volume up, volume, down, cycle through cancellation levels etc. fav1, fav2, fav3 could be single, double and triple tap on the left earbuds instead of just restricted to noise cancellation.","Reviewed in the United States on 26 October 2020","Fantastic Earbuds but not for everyone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","","3","Triple Black"

You could say I'm a Bose fan; I've had QC 25, 30, 35 and a pair of SoundLink Revolve.  I've also got a pair of Airpods to compare with.  I used all the above with Mac Book Pros, iPhones, Android phones, and Windows laptops.Let's start with the nice things.  It's great quality hardware; the earbuds and case feel and look great.  Sound quality was fine, no bluetooth connectivity issues.  Nobody hearing me has ever complained about microphone quality.  Battery life is fine.  Noise cancellation met my expectations; I couldn't fairly compare  these earbuds to the QC 25/30/35 without a controlled experiment.  Fit is good- very comfortable, even- and I have sensitive ears I can't wear on-ear headphones or use most earbuds.Now the disappointments.  Charging case is a bit large; fine for cargo shorts or a backpack, not so much for dress pants or the like.  Wireless range is perhaps 3/4 that of Airpods in realistic indoor environments- not a deal-breaker but definitely noticeable.  The ""Bose Music"" app; thankfully they dropped the requirement to create an account just to pair earbuds, but it's annoying that I have to install it for the earbuds and ""Bose Connect"" for all my other Bose devices.  Only the right earbud can be used standalone (with Airpods either the right or left can be used by itself).  Finally, I've found the earbuds don't switch between devices quite as smoothly as the QC35- again, not a deal-breaker but a minor annoyance when you've got a phone and a laptop.In short, given the price I'd hold out for a ""second generation"" hardware revision.","Reviewed in the United States on 21 October 2021","Wait for a few software updates or a new hardware revision","3.0 out of 5 stars","","2","Triple Black"
"R11DR2VZ10F2RK","Buy2MuchPrime","For context I love music and this is my 3rd pair of Bose noise cancelling headphones / earbuds. Just for context I also own what people may call audiophile headphones (Audeze LCD-XC, Dekoni Blues, and HD660s).  If you are looking for best in class noise cancelling earbuds, look no further.  If you are looking for a great sound signature and don't care about noise cancelling, look somewhere else.  The biggest shock to me was that they don't block out sound like a QC35 would, these let in a bit more ambient sound.  I'm guessing this is so that you can hear what is around you (even in quiet mode).  Sound stage isn't very large, the highs and mids are lacking, and the bass, well its bose, there is plenty of bass. Problem is this does make for muddy sounding music, especially with female vocals.  I find the earbuds fit nicely, and do a good enough job on the subway blocking out noise.  My only true complaint would be battery life, knowing full well that the audio quality  wouldn't compare to an LCD-XC as an example.  Unlike Beats or other headphones, I have nothing but a solid bluetooth connection with my Samsung S21 Ultra.

"R3B5TQC90AJLW4","Curly Girl","I am a longtime Bose fan and have had several other types of Bose ear buds over the years.  They are my go-to brand. I have always found the sound quality, noise cancellation, and comfort are top notch and was prepared to love  these  “true” wireless earbuds as much as my previous Bose products. The sound quality and noise cancellation are on par with my previous Bose experience. As other reviewers have stated the buds are larger and heavier than other similar earbuds on the market. I didn’t think they looked as huge on as I thought they would but they are  heavier and don’t stay in the ear as well as my past Bose earbuds, especially with movement  (I did try  the different size ear pieces that came with the product). That minor inconvenience would have been tolerable but the deal breaker was I couldn’t get a working pair! The first set the left earbud didn’t work at all, despite charging the buds and case fully and following troubleshooting from both Bose and Amazon. That set went back for an exchange. The 2nd set the right earbud had constant static, whether or not music was playing. Again, troubleshooting didn’t help so that set went back too. One set not working I could see, but 2?? I am disappointed  to have to move to another wireless product and hope my experience is not indicative of a change in quality in Bose products. The sound quality is full and rich with excellent noise cancellation-easily 5 stars for those features. Not being able to get a working set knocked off a couple of stars.","Reviewed in the United States on 2 November 2021","Wanted to love them","3.0 out of 5 stars","","6","Soapstone"
"R2VXZ2YSSPSNV5","casper1021ax","I'm a huge Bose fan. Have wireless QC over the ear headphones that I love. These are no exception when it comes to sound quality, noise cancelation, and battery life. You won't find better anywhere else. But the connectivity when switching between devices is horrific. Can only connect to one device at a time, and they mean it. They certainly stay connected once you're there. But God forbid you want to connect to your phone after previously being connected to your tablet. The instructions say that you literally have to turn Bluetooth off on the previous device before connecting to a new computer device, and it's true. If I power my tablet off while these are still connected, I have to actually power back on the tablet, reconnect and turn off the Bluetooth before I can connect to my phone, or else I have to re-pair. It's like this with all devices, firestick, laptop, etc. I'm essentially re-pairing these things 4+ times a day. It's not my devices, the instructions that come with these buds speak to this issue. For $280, that's a huge hassle. The airpods I'm replacing functioned better than this and I have all android products. My over the ear headphones don't do this. You can connect to multiple devices, of course, only playing from one device at a time. But switching is seemless. I guess I'll live with these for a few years, but other buyers beware. If I would have known about this issue, I probably would have gone another route. It may seem like a small thing, but there's a cumulative toll this ""inconvenience"" takes after having these for a month if you use them daily. It just shouldn't be this hard at this price point.","Reviewed in the United States on 19 August 2021","Switching the connection from one device to another is the worst.

"R2UT8HS3695IP3","T. H.","Als Allererstes: Eigentlich bin ich ein sehr überzeugter User von Bose-Produkten. Egal um welches Produkt es sich handelte, ich war immer vollkommen zufrieden. Die Earbuds haben mich leider nicht zu 100% überzeugt.Pros: Die Tonqualität ist einwandfrei. Es fehlt zwar ein Equalizer, aber das stört nicht wirklich. Sowohl der Klang als auch das Noise-Cancelling sind hervorragend. Da gibt es nichts zu beanstanden. Klingt fantastisch. Die Akku-Laufzeit, sowie die Ladezeit, sind sehr solide. Zudem bieten die Earbuds einen stabilen Halt. Ich arbeite in der Zustellung und nutze dabei einen Earbud, um den tristen Zustellungsalltag mit etwas Musik zu erhellen und um unterwegs gut erreichbar zu sein, falls mal ein Kollege anruft. Mit einem doppelten Tippen auf den Earbud absolut kein Problem. Insgesamt ein rundes Gesamtpaket aus Klangqualität, Akkulaufzeit und sicherem Halt.Cons: Die Bluetoothverbindung ist zwar stabil, wenn sie einmal hergestellt wurde, aber teils gibt es arge Probleme beim Connecten. Manchmal benötigt man mehrere Versuche bis es gelingt eine Verbindung herzustellen. Ich besitze inzwischen das 2. Paar, da bei den ersten Earbuds nach einer Nutzung von circa 1,5 Wochen der linke Bud teilweise nur halb so laut war wie der rechte. Zurücksetzen und neu verbinden, lösten das Problem leider nicht und ich musste die Earbuds einschicken. Laut Google ist das kein Einzelfall. Der Support und sofortige Umtausch muss definitiv lobend erwähnt werden, andererseits sollte solch ein Fehler bei einem Preis von 200€+ nicht wirklich auftreten.Das verbaute Mikrofon ist nicht gut. Es reicht um zu telefonieren. Man wird verstanden. Bei Zoom-Meetings oder Voice-Mails bei Whatsapp, entkoppelt man die Earbuds lieber oder stellt die Audio-Eingabe auf das Standard-Mic des Laptops. Damit tut man seinem Gegenüber in jedem Fall einen Gefallen.Ein weiterer Punkt, der Abzüge in der Wertung gibt, ist folgender: Man kann zwar auch nur mit einem Earbud Musik hören, jedoch ausschließlich mit dem rechten. Da ich die Buds, bzw. den Bud, während der Zustellung nutze, kann ich nur mit einem Musik hören, da ich auch auf Geräusche im Straßenverkehr achten muss. Bisher stellte das noch kein Problem dar, da die Buds noch recht neu sind und der Akku noch ordentlich hält. Mit zunehmender Nutzung wird die Akku-Laufzeit abnehmen. Da muss man sich nichts vormachen. Hier wäre zumindest die Option sehr nett gewesen einfach mit dem linken Bud weiter Musik zu hören, falls der rechte leer ist. Natürlich nutzt man im Normalfall beide Buds gleichzeitig und es wird nicht viele User wie mich geben, die auf dieses Feature wert legen.Insgesamt bieten die Earbuds einen wirklich sehr guten Klang. Die Basics sind meiner Meinung nach auch wirklich gut erfüllt. Allerdings weisen die Buds in anderen Punkten Schwächen auf, die zumindest erwähnt werden sollten. Vor dem Kauf des Produkts sollte man sich definitiv genau informieren, ob die Buds den persönlichen Ansprüchen entsprechen.","Reviewed in Germany on 12 August 2021","Die Tonqualität ist top, der Rest ist eher Durchschnitt","3.0 out of 5 stars","","2","Triple Black"

Secondo giorno comincia a saltare ogni 10 minuti la connessione della cuffia sinistra; dopo un tentativo di reset per eliminare il problema, son diventate impossibili da connettere a qualsiasi dispositivo.

Mi aspettavo molto di più; il segnale salta ogni giorno, almeno una volta ogni 2/3 ore. Le uso per la maggior parte con iPhone: l'app scaricata, dopo l'ultimo aggiornamento, ha fatto aggiornare anche il firmware delle cuffie. Rimosso la modifica agile del livello ""cancellazione rumore"", che è una delle cose fondamentali e che insieme al volume uno regola più spesso (super errore rimuoverla dalla finestra principale dell'app, secondo me). La batteria viene indicata con pochissima precisione, perché varia de 10% alla volta e inoltre l'unico modo per sapere il livello del case è aprirlo (scomodo!).Qualità e performance molto alte, però speravo fossero molto più ""agili"" e complete come funzioni.

"R3PHDLI9692SSK","Angel","First off Bose is a great manufacturer for any noise cancelling devices and this product was top-notch in sound quality and comfortability. From when you open the box to its premium case to the premium earbuds definitely one of the tops in the market. However the reason why I gave this product three stars was for three reasons: I was very surprised on this but first off they have no find my earbud option in the event that you misplace or lose it. You would think paying over $300 earbuds there better be something to find them like there was on the free sports that I previously owned  and knowing Bose they'll probably want you to buy another set even though you can buy a different earbud but who wants to go through that. I tried to use the old app Bose connect to see if it would work but it says it's only compatible with free sport  earbuds . So in reality Bose took a step back on this one and  you can't equalize the music on the app. Secondly there is no physical way to adjust volume like other earbuds out there and you have to do it straight from the phone. I'm pretty active and hit the gym so whenever he get real moving sometimes you need a quick up and down message without taking your entire phone now put the volume but that's just me. Final reason was the poor customer service that Bose gave and to this day has not responded back with my questions and had to try to get them from the Amazon tech support which was an obvious fail as well after bouncing from 8 reps. I'm still a big fan of Bose products however this came up way short for me especially with the price tag that it has when there are better suited earbuds out there in the market for way cheaper.

"R2CQ4Y69KVTGBP","Amazon Customer","Had to return sport buds for signal dropping issue. I do like these QC buds, but I am having a few issues with these, too. The sound is excellent. Especially with Amazon's ultra HD music. I do wish the base was a bit more pronounced. The sport buds had it but these QCs are not as strong. Great mid range, though. The transparency mode is excellent. The ANC works great when it's on but when I turn it off I hear ocean noises. It sounds like ocean waves or even better it sounds like I'm on a cruise ship and the noise the ship makes as it cuts through the ocean water. While I love that sound, I don't appreciate it in my buds. And while it has only happened a couple of times it is worth noting the slide bar that I use in the app to control the level of ANC sometimes does not work. I'll slide it to a higher level and the level in ear buds doesn't adjust. If I go back and reslide it, it will work. The double tap to pause and unpause music is unreliable. It works more often than not but I find myself needing to go back to my phone to unpause my music when the double tap does not work. I am a fan of Bose. If they can work out these kinks it would be a near perfect purchase. I do have one more complaint...at almost $300 how does Bose, and even other manufacturers,  not provide ability to connect to two blue tooth devices simultaneously?  At this price point, it should be required.","Reviewed in the United States on 22 June 2021","Not having good luck with Bose","3.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Soapstone"

Da fan di bose ho deciso di acquistarle lo stesso, e niente, anche le mie difettate: fermavano musica e video da sole, attivavano l assistente vocale (siri) del telefono, alzavano e abbassavano il volume senza che lo chiedessi… ho chiesto quindi il cambio a amazon e come sempre sono stati perfetti, mi sono arrivate le cuffie nuove addirittura prima di aver spedito quelle difettate. Le nuove sono perfette, ottime cuffie, alta qualità del suono e dopo qualche giorno anche i “tasti” (a sfioramento) sono comodi e intuitivi. Le dimensioni sono un po’ abbondanti ma è solo un fatto estetico, indossate non danno fastidio, dovete però abituarvi a come si “agganciano” all orecchio (o lo ami o lo odi). Anche la batteria dura molte ore, sia delle cuffie sia del case, non mi è capitato mai di scaricarle completamente. Migliori delle airpods pro. Non ho provato le sony. Forse il prezzo di listino è un po alto ma si trovano sempre scontate sui 200-220€. In conclusione dovete essere fortunati, se vi arrivano senza difetti sono delle grandissime cuffie, forse le migliori nel loro genere, ma da bose questo controllo qualità imbarazzante non me lo aspettavo, in tantissimi siamo qua a lamentarci di questi difetti.

While the noise cancellation lives up to the billing the product quality was absolutely sub par.The right ear on the pair I purchased stopped charging after a month. No drops, no damage just out of the blue it stopped working. Was disappointed but it was under warranty so customer service replaced them.The replacement pair turned out even more disappointing. Two weeks into using it there was an issue with the in-ear sensor and it stopped playing audio. Turns out it's a common issue with the headphones and it's been reported by others before. Additionally, they began to randomly drop Audio during calls, which rendered them further useless.Once might have been an aberration but to face these issues on two seperate pairs highlights that Bose might be slipping as a manufacturer.

Es hat trotz Google ne ganze weile gedauert das Problem zu identifizieren. Man muss dann in den Handy Einstellungen unter dem Bluetooth (profil) AAC ausstellen.

Anticipo que puede haber sido simplemente mala suerte, y me ha tocado el producto que fallaba.Tras varios días mirando opiniones, características, etc. de los distintos modelos con cancelación de ruido (Senheiser, Apple, Sony...), decidí esperarme a la salida de los Bose. Precio inicial bastante por encima de las otras firmas, pero bueno, son BOSE. Primeras reseñas tirando a malas, pero...son BOSE. De repente se produce una bajada de precio igualando a las otras opciones y... es el empujoncito que me faltaba. Total, acabé comprando pese a reseñas malas, ¡pero es que son BOSE!  El dolor que he comentado inicialmente es porque soy muy de Bose. Tengo sistemas de sonido en casa, dos auriculares distintos, altavoz portátil... y me encantan. Desee hace años. Calidad, durabilidad...un 10.En fin, 15 minutos de prueba y el auricular izquierdo empieza a hacer un ruido molesto constante. Cambio de mvl, y ruido. Llamo, y ruido, escucho música, y ruido. No pongo nada, y ruido. Tras 3 días dando una segunda oportunidad a los Bose (quizás al dormir el auricular se arregla “solo”). Nada. Los he devuelto esta tarde.OJO, los 15 minutos iniciales, buenísimos. La cancelación de ruido es excelente. No hace el ligero zumbido como auriculares anteriores. Tengo los Bose QC 20 con NC y estoy encantado, pero la calidad en cuanto a cancelación de estos nuevos es mejor. Eso sí, aquellos que nunca habéis usado unos NC no os penséis que la cancelación es absoluta. Tiene la función que tiene, que es reducir el ruido externo, sobre todo el constante como puede ser el del tren, avión, un motor...En cuanto a comodidad, un 8.

I purchased a car mainly based on it having a bose sound system.I own the Soundsport Frees and was hoping for a good upgrade so I jumped for these when I could finally afford them. The unpacking process was great - downloading and pairing via the app was great and I found a hidden feature that allows you to adjust the volume by swiping the right earbud - should be enabled out of the box.My main issue with these was a high pitched whistle everytime I put in the right ear bud. It would happen twice like it was getting feedback. I tried restarting and resetting the product and this didn't help.The noise cancelling was pretty good but no where near the Bose 700s - I think I was expecting better however if the whistle was a fault of the noise cancelling then I can only assume that the noise cancelling was faulty and therefore I can't comment on it too much. They look better and sit better on your ear than the soundsport frees.I think had I got a fully working product I'd be rating this as a 4/5 - the only other slight downside is: double tapping the buds creates this hollow thud that's quite loud (same as the 700s) - given this is the main interface for play pause etc I can see it annoying some people.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 December 2020","Good but worse than expected","3.0 out of 5 stars","","42","Triple Black"

Ja, der Sound ist im InEar Bereich sehr gut - aber irgendwie gleichförmig. Ich vermute, das liegt am automatischen EQ, den man nicht ausschalten kann (oder ich habe es noch nicht gefunden). Das ANC ist natürlich überragend, da habe ich nichts anderes erwartet. Der Tragekomfort finde ich mäßig! In meinen Ohren sitzen die Soundsport Free sehr viel besser und vor allem (gefühlt) sicherer. Der Haken, den man im Ohr verkeilt, ist deutlich weicher geworden. Das ist für einige sicher angenehm, ich finde es unsicher. Ich bin da wirklich gespannt auf die Sleepbuds ii, die ich vorbestellt habe. Bei der ersten Generation hat man die Flügel schon ein bisschen gemerkt und da die Sleepbuds im Ohr verschwinden, wäre da eine weicherer Variante schon sinnig.

Il colore che ho scelto ovvero il bianco tenendo conto degli sconti costa 50€ in più, una differenza assurda ma vabbé ho fatto 30 faccio 31. Passo dritto al punto: l'audio è si soddisfacente, Corposo, pieno, potente. Per sentire le note basse come Dio comanda però occorre alzare al massimo il volume e qui vengono fuori le note dolenti ovvero le tonalità più alte che a volte gracchiano e volte danno fastidio.. Dato il costo non dovrebbero esserci certi fastidi. I comandi touch devo essere sincero non penso li userò molto perché non li vedo granché precisi, anzi.. Spero sia solo per il fatto che le ho appena ricevute e devo farci la mano. Altra caratteristica per me fondamentale è che sono semplici da indossare e soprattutto NON escono mai e poi mai dall'orecchio. Potevo spendere centinaia e centinaia di euro ma i gommini sono tutti uguali e trovo questo assurdo perché con quello che costano non dovrebbero assolutamente perdere aderenza o cadere a caso mentre cammino, con le Bose questo non succede e non è mai successo perché da anni (le prime le ho prese penso 10 anni fa) usano materiali diversi per gli auricolari e l'archetto che le tiene saldamente agganciate senza dar fastidio.

Was mein Sitznachbar abends noch vor hat und was der Gegenüber zum Abend essen von seiner Frau serviert bekommt.PROBLEM:Das interessiert mich alles gar nicht!!! Folglich fand ich das Konzept der Noise Cancelling Kopfhörer für mich sehr sinnvoll und stöberte im Internet welche denn nun besonders gut sind.Ein Produkt mit angebissenem Apfel kam für mich nicht in Frage.++~ Ruhe!!! Ja, meinetwegen auch manchmal ein Rauschen. Aber endlich Ruhe in den Öffis. Die Mitfahrer öffnen und schließen ihre Münder wie lebende Fische an Land...aber ich höre nix. Selbst schreiende Kinder werden meist komplett weg gefiltert. Ich höre lediglich meine Musik und manchmal gedämpfte Geräusche. Vieles ist scheinbar Einstellungssache über die App.~ Die Laufzeit finde ich sehr gut.~ Die Ladezeit vom Case ist, aus meiner Sicht, vollkommen in Ordnung.~ Der Klang: Ich finde den Klang sehr gut. Ja, ein wenig mehr Bass wäre schön. Das läßt sich vielleicht in Teilen über die App anpassen. Das habe ich nicht sehr ausführlich ausprobiert.~ Im Gegensatz zu meinen Galaxy Ear Buds, kann ich mich mit Kopfhörern auf die Seite legen, ohne dass die Kopfhörer sich deaktivieren oder das Ganze als Toucheingabe registrieren.~ Bei den ""normalen"" Kopfhörern habe ich sehr schnell vom Tragen ein Druckgefühl in den Ohren, so dass ich diese meist nicht lange tragen kann. Die Bose Kopfhörer kann ich deutlich länger tragen und ich empfinde sie als angenehm im Ohr.~ Wertiges Case: Gefällt mir.~ Die Unterbrechung von Musik/Videos funktioniert super, sobald man einen Ohrhörer aus dem Ohr heraus nimmt. Ebenso die anschließende Wiedergabe nach dem Wiedereinsetzen.--~Leider brauchte es 3!!! Anläufe bis ich voll funktionierende Kopfhörer erhielt:* Beim ersten riß beim rechten Hörer immer wieder die Bluetooth Verbindung ab, was ein lautes Knacken zur Folge hatte, das sehr unangenehm klang.* Beim zweiten wollte dafür der Linke Kopfhörer von Anfang an gar nicht. Der Akku des Hörers war leer, eine Verbindung lies sich nicht herstellen und die integrierten LEDs wechselten zwischen rot und blau.Beide gingen zurück zu Amazon. Vielen Dank für die problemlose und schnelle Übersendung der Ersatzkopfhörer!~ Die Bluetoothverbindung reißt manchmal schon bei geringer Reichweite ab, das wird meist durch einen unangenehmen Piepton und oder lautes Rauschen begleitet.~ AppZwang: Ohne App und ggf.

"R1ZMGMZFRAGT20","Fonkyfonkybaby","Pour donner un peu de contexte à ce commentaire, j'avais initialement jeté mon dévolu sur les Sony WF-1000XM3, concurrent principal des Bose QC Earbuds. L'inconfort des Sony a fait que j'ai finalement changé.*Le confort : inégalable, c'est la paire d'écouteurs la plus confortable qu'il m'ait été donné de porter de toute mon existence ! Les écouteurs se ""chaussent"" facilement et ne bougent plus. Ils sont comme aimantés à l'oreille. Ils ne pénètrent pas dans le conduit auditif, mais se posent dessus, avec un scellé parfait. Plusieurs heures d'écoute sont possible sans créer la moindre douleur ou gêne.*La réduction de bruit : impressionnante : par rapport aux Sony WF-1000XM3, il y a une nette amélioration. La réduction ne crée pas de parasite, mais marche admirablement bien. J'ai été surpris de son efficacité.*Le son : excellent, mais marqué par la signature Bose : un poil trop de basses à mon goût et peut être un tout petit peu moins dynamiques que les Sony sur la partie aïgus/mediums. Sur ce point les Sony WF-1000XM3 me semblaient légèrement supérieurs. Le son reste excellent, attention. L'absence d'égaliseur dans l'application de Bose, avec des préréglages (comme sur le Sony) est dommage car elle permettrait de palier cela.*L'application (importante, car on est sur un produit qui a besoin de son application pour être utilisée de manière optimum) : bien mais peut mieux faire. Par exemple : il manque la possibilité d'éteindre les écouteurs (j'y reviens plus bas). Il manque aussi un égaliseur. Et la possibilité de savoir  où on en est niveau réduction de bruit manque également (on peut augmenter ou diminuer la réduction de bruit, avec la faculté d'avoir une restitution numérique des sons de l'extérieur, captée par les micros...mais ce qui aurait été sympa, c'est de savoir quand la réduction de bruit active est activée -et donc quand on est simplement sur l'isolation ""mécanique"" des écouteurs-, et quand la restitution numérique de l'extérieur intervient...cela permettrait par exemple de désactiver au besoin la réduction de bruit, simplement, sans intégrer la restitution numérique de l'extérieur qui vient parasiter la musique).*L'autonomie : très bonne, rien à dire.Un des points les plus gênants de mon point de vue (outre l'absence d'égaliseur) est l'absence de possibilité d'éteindre les écouteurs  autrement qu'en les remettant dans la boite et en la fermant. Hors de l'oreille, ils restent actifs (le son est en pause, mais ils sont actifs et perdent de l'autonomie, de manière notable) pendant 20 minutes avant de se mettre en veille. Ce qui veut dire que si on veut les poser 30 minutes, soit on les rentre dans la boite qu'on doit refermer pour qu'ils s'éteignent (chiant, surtout qu'il faut les nettoyer pour pas pourrir la boite), soit on les laisse se décharger bêtement.Avec les Sony par exemple, l'application permettait de les mettre hors tension. Ce qui évitait de les rentrer dans la boite toutes les 5 minutes.Quand je suis au boulot et que je dois les quitter l'espace d'1/2 heure, le temps de les remettre ils ont perdu 10 à 15% de batterie pour rien, dans le vide, parce qu'ils sont restés actifs 20 minutes...stupide !Si encore la veille intervenait au bout de 5 minutes (comme pour les sony)...Je terminerai par les points accessoires :- la boite : j'ai lu de nombreuses critiques comme quoi elle était encombrante : pas plus que cela je trouve,- les écouteurs sont beaux, j'avais peur qu'ils fassent ""cheap"" au vu des photos, mais non.- ce confort...je n'en reviens toujours pas.En somme, je ne regrette pas mon achat (ni l'abandon des Sony, affreusement conçus du point de vue de l'ergonomie. Dommage qu'il reste les petits défauts mentionnés plus haut, qui pourraient être résolus si simplement (quoique je peux comprendre la position de ne pas mettre d'égaliseur, c'est un choix).","Reviewed in France on 2 March 2021","Un confort absolu (et probablement inégalable), une réduction du bruit impressionnante","4.0 out of 5 stars","","51","Triple Black"
"R28W28YYF7EV2E","Zaia","I love how these earbuds were working straight out of the box!!! Super user-friendly!!!Charging case: So many people were complaining about the case being large and difficult to open. But to me the size feels perfect (sturdy) and feels easy to open. Maybe Bose updated the design.User-friendly: The Bose app provides a clear guide on how to use all the touch controls on the earbuds. FYI I immediately diabled voice control because it felt intrusive and louder than the music.Noise-cancelling: Incredible. Hits the mark. I could barely hear the music blasting from my Marshall speakers. I didn't think it would be useful to toggle between different degrees of noise cancellation, but I can see why it would be helpful to tune in and out of our environment.Audio quality: wow, we can even adjust the equalizer on the app!Disappointment: Why can I hear my own footsteps while walking? I don't walk that hard, so this is a surprise!!

"R2WHZJT42ER7SL","Mr Lewis","►TL;DR: Worst in every way than the amazing Sony WF1000XM4s, except for comfort - which made the Bose an unlikely winner for me!They have equally magical ANC, too, to be fair; both were able to totally mask loud conversation and TV in the same room, with the aid of some quiet music. While the Jabra 85T's had negligible noise cancelling and fitted too loose (so went back to Amazon immediately.These Bose ear-buds have an ear-tip system which is comfortable for up to an hour, for me. Verses only ~20 minutes for the Sony's. The Bose securely nestle in my fussy little ears, using the small size tips. Even though their prong doesn't extend into the fold at the back of my outer-ear, like the less comfortable mediums, they still don't shake loose.They're quick and pleasant to quickly pop in and out, with a little twist. While the Sony's need a cumbersome process of compressing the foam tips, inserting them into the ear canal and holding them in place for 10 seconds or so until they fully expand to seal and hold secure. The pressure of which just gets too uncomfortable for me. Even with softer (expensive!) tips by ""Comply"".► The issues with these Bose buds:(1) They are bigger than the Sony's, with a case about double to size! Even bigger than it need be to accommodate the much bigger tips.(2) Bluetooth connection is high latency, even with a 5.0 dongle, it's ~200ms on PC, making decisive FPS game sounds disorientingly desynchronised - delayed like an echo. Same for lip sync with any video source without manual AV sync adjustments. So really these are limited to music and calls, in my opinion. While the Sony's sound to have a <50ms latency (making all games playable), even to a desktop PC using an old 4.0 dongle. Which contradicts RTing's >200ms review measurement, and I don't even understand how it's possible...(3) There's a Bluetooth connect button in the Bose case, which you might think could help increase connectivity support... But these buds sometimes wouldn't connect at all to my old Android 7.0 phone. (Fine now with my new Android 11 OnePlus 8T.) And PC with iffy. While the Sony's *just worked* straight off in all cases, with no case button.(4) The user interface of the Bose buds is unnecessarily limited and awkward compared to the Sony's (and the Jabra's even more so). Either skip track forwards *or* backward can only be optionally enabled for long touch on the left bud (weirdly counter-intuitive). That is, taking up the ""Shortcut"" button input. I think this is because the right bud has swipe up/down for volume - gesture input, not slider. It's imprecise and easy to go way too far. I've used it a little, in practice, but in principle volume control is more easily done from the side buttons on any phone.(5) A separate additional app is required from the one used for my Bose QC35ii headphones, for some reason. It's vaguely functional and it updated the UI options, just after I bought them, to move the 3 ""favourite"" ANC settings (1 to 10 level) towards a more sane: On/Transparent toggle (with optional off setting).(6) The case lid catch is very hard to release with the button. I think this part design, part quality control issue. Bad feel to getting them out each time there, sadly, for a premium product. Flustering if the button doesn't work a couple times with trying to get them out to take a call, quickly.(7) None of the buds were any good at cancelling the low pitched noises that penetrate through my loft conversion walls and windows. That is, compared with my 3 year old QC35ii headphones. Although, conversely, these headphones are near useless at suppressing any mid to high frequency sounds within the same room, by comparison.(8) Neither buds were suitable for wearing in bed while trying to lay on my side. Obviously they all stick out slightly too much, although the Sony's got closer to being viable. (Maybe with a fatter, softer pillow.) Ironically, despite being much bigger, my over-ear headphones work best, here. (By using a pillow either side of my head with a crack in the middle for the cups and band.) While the buds are too prone to making in-ear noises when moving, and pressing into my ears and knocking loose.(9) No wind noise suppression on the Bose - I was quite impressed with how this mode, exclusively on the Sony's, was able to cut out the air movement rustling noise from a desk fan pointed at my face. I.e. to simulate walking outside in weather.(10) Sound was good (for my indie/rock music) and 3 band EQ in the app let me tweak it very slightly to my preference.► Conclusion:So anyway, I'm sadly selling the Sony's and persevering with these Bose. I mean, they're alright for £180 on Black Friday sale. Although I won't get as much use out of them as I hoped. They're easier enough to carry about in a big pocket, where I wouldn't take my headphones. And I've used them a couple of times for mobile phone calls just fine.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2022","Superior comfort & convienience with unbeaten ANC but inferior Bluetooth, odd UI & bluky case","4.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Aur4rf++L.jpg

"RIVYFLZ6Q6GIX","Silverware","Li ho acquistati durante il Black Friday a €160 su un prezzo di listino di quasi €280 perché volevo provare da tempo un prodotto Bose di fascia alta, poi ho letto diverse recensioni negative riguardo all'esperienza d'uso, ma dopo averli provati devo dire che non sono affatto pentito.La qualità del suono e la cancellazione del rumore sono effettivamente ai massimi livelli, bassi profondi e puliti, suono avvolgente, perfetti per l'ascolto della musica ""in immersione"".La parte su cui avevo letto la maggior quantità di commenti negativi era quella relativa ai comandi, ma Bose ha fatto degli aggiornamenti al firmware che ne hanno migliorato sensibilmente l'usabilità e non ho riscontrato alcuna difficoltà, anzi i comandi touch li ho trovati responsivi e facili da usare. Due tap per play/pausa o rispondi/attacca, swipe su/giù per il volume, gli unici nei sono che non si può disattivare l'assistente vocale che può aprirsi per errore e che la traccia avanti/indietro non è implementata come si deve, si può scegliere solo una di queste due opzioni impostando una scorciatoia, non tutte e due, cosa che non ha nessun senso. Anche la noiosa vocetta che ti dice se hai il suono ambientale acceso o spento ogni volta che cambi modalità si dovrebbe eliminare, a che serve? A interrompere l'ascolto? Tanto si sente, spariscono i suoni!La pausa quando togli l'auricolare comunque funziona alla perfezione. Anche l'audio durante le telefonate si è dimostrato eccellente, le persone con cui parlavo non si sono nemmeno accorti che portavo gli auricolari.Devo lodare in modo particolare anche il comfort, le ho portate per 4 ore di fila e non mi hanno dato nessun fastidio ai padiglioni auricolari né senso di pesantezza, è la prima volta che degli auricolari non finiscono per darmi dolore o prurito dopo più di un'ora di uso continuato. Non li ho ancora provati facendo sport, ma sembrano piuttosto stabili.La scatola, è vero, è grossa e pesante rispetto alla concorrenza, ma in qualche modo si fa apprezzare così come l'ingombro un po' elevato degli auricolari perché danno la sensazione di un prodotto ""importante"" (almeno a me), e poi il design degli auricolari mi fa impazzire.Se li avessi acquistati a prezzo pieno probabilmente avrei detto di poter chiedere di più, 280 euro sono davvero un'esagerazione, ma a quasi metà del prezzo di listino li definirei un buon affare. Perlomeno i migliori auricolari wireless che abbia acquistato finora (è il mio terzo paio, prima ho avuto dei Creative Outlier Gold e dei Panasonic).","Reviewed in Italy on 23 November 2022","Per chi cerca la qualità, anche se non è tutto rose e fiori","4.0 out of 5 stars","","14","Soapstone"

White noise will always be present at any setting below 10, where its almost unnoticeable.Feels heavy after a longer period of wearing them, especially if the fit in ear isn't the best.Touch implementation isn't the best as there isn't any feedback to confirm touches or swipes. You cannot customise or have either ear do the same functions. E.g. Have skip track on both ear buds.Battery life is almost as advertised in my usage, so very good on that front!Case is on the large side and isn't particularly pocketable.

"R7AM8R07MXYG","J.M. Parsons","I bought these to replace my Bose SoundSport earbuds, which finally gave up the ghost after about five years.A quick word about the SoundSport buds: I went through four different sets, all replaced at no charge--even when they were out of warranty. The first set stopped holding a charge after less than a year. Replaced. The switch on the right bud disintegrated after a year. Bose replaced the unit even though it was out of warranty. The left bud got very faint and ultimately stopped working altogether. Replaced out of warranty by Bose. The current one, which has worked well for about 18 months, has lost sound on the left bud. I figure I've gotten my money's worth, so I haven't contacted Bose this time--I just bought the QC instead.I mention my issues with the SoundSport because I have concerns about Bose's quality control, at least for that particular unit. I bought a pair of Apple AirPod Pro but returned them after a couple of days because I have an Android phone (Galaxy Note 20), and most of the attractive features of the AirPods don't work on my phone or are cumbersome.So I went for the QC with only minor reservations.Here's what I like about them:* They sound very, very good--better than my SoundSport. I listen mainly to audiobooks, which aren't particularly demanding, but the sound is noticeably better--even to my (ahem) ""older"" ears. (When you ride a motorcycle fast without earplugs for a lot of years, you pay a price. Pay attention, kids!) The music I listen to is largely acoustic--guitar, mandolin and violin. The sound is very pleasant, with good detail and strong bass. I don't have to turn the volume higher to get the nuances of the music. That is definitely a plus.* They are very secure in my ears and very comfortable--more so than their predecessor. I expect they'll stay put even when I work out and sweat heavily.* The noise canceling is spookily effective. I listen to audiobooks in my car, which has a fair amount of road noise. It's a Porsche, and I tend to drive pretty fast. The noise-canceling is good enough that I don't have to raise the volume. I have not tried different-sized ear tips but might see if the noise canceling is even more effective with a different size.* The QC works quite well for phone calls. I have had no complaints from people about intelligibility or noise. One very welcome feature is that I can adjust how much of my voice I can hear on calls. The SoundSport did not have that, so being able to hear myself when I talk on phone calls is good. I set the option to 100%.* The controls are okay: tap the right bud twice to answer or terminate a phone call, swipe up or down on the right bud to raise or lower the volume. Tapping twice on the right bud pauses and restarts the audio player.* The battery life is longer than I expected. I listen to audiobooks to fall asleep. I set the ""sleep"" function on my app to 10 minutes. In the morning, I still have about 20% battery after eight hours.* The charging case has been good for three full charges from 20% to full—also more than I expected. Some have complained about its size, but it's not uncomfortable to carry around in my pocket--it weighs 3.3 oz (93 grams) and measures 3.25"" x 2"" x  1.5"" tall (82 mm x 50 mm x 38 mm).There are some missing features, but they are not deal killers for me.* There is no way to fast forward through an audio program. The SoundSport allowed me to double- or triple-click and hold the control button on the mic to fast forward. There is no equivalent on the QC. I have to go to the phone for those functions.* The SoundSport went into sleep mode when not playing content. I was able to go a week between charges because of that feature. Also not a deal killer, as the battery life is longer than I expected with the QC.* There is no way to power the QC down other than putting them in the charging case.* There does not appear to be a way to locate a lost earbud--a ""find my bud"" feature. That is my biggest concern. There is still a video on the Bose site showing how to use Find My Buds--in the obsolete Bose Connect app. This is close to a deal killer. I cannot understand why this feature has been disabled in one of Bose's flagship products. The QC are quite a bit larger than the Apple product, so they won't be quite as easy to lose. I hope.Overall, I am very happy with this purchase. I use earbuds every day, so I am quite particular about getting a set that works well. So far, these fill the bill. I hope not to have to deal with the kinds of QC issues I had with the SoundSport.Bose offers a 90-day unconditional return policy, although I would have bought these without it.They are pricey, but I have always found that paying top dollar for the best quality winds up being the best investment over time.","Reviewed in the United States on 26 February 2021","Excellent, but with some surprising shortcomings","4.0 out of 5 stars","","40","Triple Black"

"R1FRZXY9AUOI5F","W4LK3R","... und das zeigen sie mehr als deutlich mit ihrer relativ großen Größe, dem großen Ladeetui und dem sensationellen Klangerlebnis, das nicht einfach in eine Hosentasche gezwängt gehört! Aber fangen wir vorne an.Mein Start mit diesen Earbuds war ein eher sehr durchwachsener, da das erste Paar leider mit einem Verarbeitungsfehler geliefert wurde. Das Gehäuse des rechten Buds hat angefangen, sich an der Klebestelle zu lösen, wodurch sowohl eine Lücke als auch der Kleber in ihr sichtbar war. Störend? Im Grunde nur ein optischer Makel, der in dieser Preisregion aber absolut inakzeptabel ist. Es ist mir nicht verständlich, wie sowas durch die Qualitätskontrolle kommen konnte, auch wenn ich diesen Umstand nicht in meine Sternebewertung einfließen lassen möchte, da ich nur die Buds ansich bewerten möchte, denn Pech kann man auch bei Bose mal haben. Also sofort zurückgeschickt, fehlerfreier Ersatz kam am nächsten Tag, vielen Dank an Amazon!Ich werde im Folgenden auf einzelne Aspekte genauer eingehen, die ich nun nach zwei Tagen Alltagsnutzung bewerte.--- Ersteindruck & Inhalte ---Etwas ernüchternd. Geliefert werden die Buds in einem dunkelgrauen Karton mit Plastikaufhängung oben, umhüllt von Pappe mit dem Produktbild und den üblichen Angaben darauf. Auch im Inneren geht es eher nüchtern zu, das Etui mit den Buds in der Mitte einer Plastikschale, darunter Bedienungsanleitung, Schnellstart-Guide, Ladekabel sowie die zwei Ohreinsätze in Größe S und L, M ist bereits an den Buds angebracht. Man hat das Gefühl, die hingen noch vor wenigen Minuten an einer Stange im Elektromarkt.Das ganze relativiert sich dann wieder ein wenig, sobald man sich das Etui und die Earbuds etwas genauer ansieht, die beide mit ihrer ziemlich edlen und wertigen Erscheinung mal so gar nicht in die Verpackung passen. Hat man letztere erstmal beiseite geschoben, geht es mit der Einrichtung weiter.--- Erstinstallation & Passform ---Die Einrichtung mit Hilfe der Bose Music App und dem beigefügten Schnellstart-Guide ist ein Kinderspiel. Nach Betätigung des Bluetooth-Buttons im Etui verbinden sich die Buds mit der App bzw. mit dem Handy, es folgen einige Tipps zum Finden der optimalen Passform. Wenn die Buds dann erstmal im Ohr sind, bleiben sie auch dort, denn dank dem zusätzlichen Bügel über dem Ohreinsatz wird ein fester Sitz erreicht, der anfangs etwas drückt und ungewohnt ist, aber mit der Zeit immer mehr in den Hintergrund tritt. Irgendwann fühlt man die Buds kaum noch, außer das durch die Größe bedingte, etwas höhere Gewicht bemerkt man natürlich ab und an im Ohr.--- Steuerung, Sound & Noise Cancelling ---Die Steuerungsmöglichkeiten an den Buds sind relativ gering, was ich aber als positiv empfinde, da die wichtigsten Funktionen dabei sind. Lieder können pausiert und übersprungen werden. DIe Lautstärke lässt sich mittlerweile dank Update auch direkt am Bud einstellen, dies muss allerdings zunächst in der App aktiviert werden. Das ANC kann auch am Bud direkt in drei verschiedenen Intensitätsstufen durchgeschaltet werden, welche in der App anpassbar sind. Außerdem können dort bestimmte Funktionen als Favoriten eingestellt werden, sodass z.B. der Akkustand bei einem Tippen auf dem Bud angesagt wird. Dieser wird jedoch auch in der App dargestellt, der Akkustand das Etuis ist an den äußeren kleinen Lämpchen erkennbar.Zum Sound gibt es nicht viel zu sagen. Er ist nicht gut, er ist (fast) perfekt, sehr gut abgestimmt auf allen Lautstärken und produziert zusammen mit dem sehr gut funktionierenden Noise-Cancelling ein Klangerlebnis, das ich so noch nicht erlebt habe. Lediglich die Höhen sind mir in diesem Klangbild etwas zu präsent, einige Rock / Heavy Metal Songs fangen hier leider an zu kreischen, was teils ziemlich unangenehm ist. Für Bassgewöhnte Ohren gibt es zu sagen, dass man hier keine Bass-Wummen erwarten sollte. Dieser ist durchaus präsent und ausreichend stark, aber natürlich kein Vergleich zu Over-Ears, den man aber auch nicht ziehen sollte! Mit Equalizern lässt sich aber jede Soundvorliebe bedienen. Leider fehlt dieser in der Bose App völlig.Das Noise Cancelling ansich funktioniert gut. Unheimlich gut. Die Welt um einen herum in Sekunden zum Stummfilm auch ohne Musik werden lassen? Kein Problem. Ich lief durch unser Stadtzentrum, lediglich mit aktiviertem NC ohne Musikwiedergabe und habe mich im ersten Moment sehr seltsam gefühlt, da man nahezu nichts mehr hören konnte. Lediglich höhere Frequenzen und lautere Gespräche kommen ab und an noch durch, ansonsten ist es einfach der pure Wahnsinn, was Bose hier auf so kleinem Raum erreicht hat. Hut ab. Hat man die Umwelt ausgeblendet, heißt es Bühne frei für den sehr guten Sound deiner Liebelingslieder.--- Fazit ---Bis auf den Preis gibt es bei den Earbuds eigentlich nichts, was einen groß davon abhalten könnte, sich diese zuzulegen, wenn man Wert auf einen hervorragenden Klang im Zusammenspiel mit sehr gutem ANC legt. Meiner Meinung nach sind die Buds ihr Geld aboslut wert und eine gute Investition. Beim Noise-Cancelling dürfte Bose die Konkurrenz mit dieser Leistung wohl ganz weit hinten gelassen haben. Der Sound ist bisher defintiv der Beste, den ich von kabellosen Buds kenne, auch wenn mir die Höhen hier etwas zu sehr ausschlagen bei bestimmter Musik.","Reviewed in Germany on 16 January 2021","Die Earbuds, die nicht einfach weggesteckt werden wollen","4.0 out of 5 stars","","3","Triple Black"

Daher habe ich eine gewisse Erwartungshaltung was den Klang und den Tragekomfort von Kopfhörern anbelangt.Kurz zum Hintergrund. Ich habe bisher die Bose SoundSport free wireless In-Ear Kopfhörer genutzt. Mit diesen bin ich nach wie vor sehr zufrieden. Als ich dann im letzten Jahr erfahren habe, dass Bose neue free wireless In-Ear Kopfhörer mit ANC plant, war ich sehr neugierig auf das Produkt. Am 05.10.2020 war es dann nach einiger Verspätung endlich soweit und die QuietComfort sind erschienen. Ich habe diese bereits im September vorbestellt, um sie dann auch pünktlich zum Release zu erhalten. In der folgenden Rezension werde ich immer mal wieder einen Vergleich sowohl zu den SoundSport free wireless als auch zu den Apple AirPods Pro herstellen. Kommen wir nun zur eigentlichen Rezension. Wem die eigentliche Rezension zu lang ist, kann auch gleich zum Fazit am Ende scrollen.Lieferumfang/Verpackung:Die Bose QuietComfort Earbuds werden in einer gut geschützten Verpackung aufbewahrt und geliefert. Von der Aufmachung her ist diese sehr schick gehalten. Insgesamt ist die Verpackung der SoundSport free wireless aber etwas hochwertiger. Im Lieferumfang befinden sich neben den Kopfhörern, das Ladecase, ein USB-Typ A auf USB-Typ C Kabel, zwei Paar Ohreinsätze in den Größen S/1 und L/3, Sicherheitshinweise und ein Quick Start Guide. Bei der Auslieferung sind die Ohreinätze in der Größe M/2 montiert.App:Bereits im Quick Start Guide wird darauf hingewiesen, dass man sich die Bose Music App auf sein Abspielgerät/Smartphone laden soll. Hier sei aber gleich angemerkt, dass der Betrieb und die Verbindung der Earbuds zum Abspielgerät auch ohne die App möglich ist. Dann sind aber keine Einstellungen, wie z. B. das Einstellen der Touch-Steuerung (Favoriten) möglich.Um die App nutzen zu können, muss man sich bei Bose registrieren und ein Benutzerkonto anlegen. Dies kann man ganz einfach nach dem Download und Start der App durchführen. Der Registrierungszwang ist ein kleiner Negativpunkt. Gerade dann, wenn man die Kopfhörer nach einem Test ggf. nicht behalten und zurückschicken möchte. (Update: Mittlerweile muss man kein Benutzerkonto mehr für die App-Nutzung anlegen. Die Einrichtung der Kopfhörer kann sofort nach der Installation der App erfolgen. Damit entfällt dieser Negativpunkt.)Nach der Registrierung werden zunächst die Kopfhörer mit der App gekoppelt. Dazu drückt man einfach den Verbindungsknopf im Ladecase. Das Koppeln ist dann in wenigen Sekunden erledigt. Nach der Kopplung erhält man diverse Hinweise bzgl. der Steuerung der Earbuds. In der App selbst kann man dann einige Einstellungen vornehmen. Dazu gehört u. a. das Regeln der Lautstärke, das Einstellen des Levels der Geräuschunterdrückung oder das Festlegen von Favoriten für die Touch-Steuerung. Zudem erhält man einige Produkttipps mit Erklärungen und Visualisierungen. Ein Equalizer beinhaltet die App jedoch nicht.Insgesamt ist die App sehr übersichtlich, modern und benutzerfreundlich gestaltet.Im Vergleich zu den Apple AirPods Pro muss man sagen, dass Apple hier leicht im Vorteil ist, da für die AirPods keine Extra App benötigt wird. Bei den AirPods werden die Einstellungen direkt in den Bluetooth Einstellungen auf dem iPhone vorgenommen. Dafür sind diese nicht so umfangreich wie bei den Bose Earbuds.Bedienung/Ansagen:Nach dem Einsetzen der Earbuds erfolgt zunächst die Ansage, mit welchem Gerät die Earbuds verbunden sind und die Ansage des Akkustands. Diese Ansagen werden im Gegensatz zum SoundSport free wireless jetzt auf beiden Kopfhörern wiedergegeben. Auch bei Telefonaten hört man den Gesprächspartner nun auf beiden Earbuds. Zudem ist jetzt auch die Nutzung des einzelnen linken Earbuds möglich. Dies war beim SoundSport free wireless noch nicht möglich. Bei diesem musste immer der rechte Earbud im Ohr oder außerhalb des Ladecase sein. Ansonsten erfolgte keine Wiedergabe auf dem linken. Das war auch einer der Kritikpunkte beim SoundSport. Hier hat Bose also nachgebessert.Anders als noch die SoundSport free wireless besitzen die QuietComfort Earbuds keine haptischen Bedienelemente mehr. Hier erfolgt die Steuerung über Touch-Elemente am Gerät selbst.Um die Wiedergabe zu starten oder zu pausieren, tippt man einfach zweimal auf den rechten Earbud. Alternativ pausiert oder startet die Wiedergabe auch, wenn man einen oder beide Earbuds aus dem Ohr nimmt oder wiedereinsetzt. Das funktioniert auch sehr gut. Sobald ein Earbud aus dem Ohr genommen wird, stoppt die Wiedergabe. Setzt man ihn wieder ein, wird diese fortgesetzt. Die Einstellung der automatischen Wiedergabe kann man in der App auch ausstellen.Um einen Anruf anzunehmen oder zu beenden, muss ebenfalls zweimal auf den rechten Ohrhörer getippt werden. Soll ein Anruf abgelehnt werden genügt es, wenn man den rechten Ohrhörer berührt und den Finger kurz darauf lässt. Der Sprachassistent wird ebenso durch drücken und halten des rechten Earbuds gestartet.Der linke Ohrhörer dient zur Einstellung der Geräuschunterdrückung. Hier kann man in der App drei Favoriten anlegen. Durch zweimaliges Tippen wird dann die jeweilige Stufe des ANC eingestellt. Weiterhin kann man durch halten des Fingers auf dem linken Earbud einen Titel überspringen oder sich alternativ den Akkustand ansagen lassen.Kommen wir nun zu einem negativen Aspekt der Touch-Steuerung. Eine Regulierung der Lautstärke oder das Zurückspringen zu einem vorherigen Titel sind leider nicht mehr möglich. Das ist nur mittels Sprachsteuerung, am Abspielgerät selbst oder z. B. mit einer Apple Watch möglich. (Durch ein Update ist die Lautstärkesteuerung mittlerweile am rechten Ohrhörer möglich.) Der SoundSport free wireless ist hier mit seinen haptischen Tasten im Vorteil, da damit sowohl das Einstellen der Lautstärke als auch das Zurückspringen zum vorherigen Titel möglich ist. Auch die AirPods Pro sind in diesem Punkt etwas besser als die Bose QuietComfort, denn mit den Apple Kopfhörern kann sowohl ein Titel vor- als auch zurückgesprungen werden. Allerdings ist eine Lautstärkeregelung auch bei diesen nicht direkt am AirPod möglich, sondern nur mittels Sprachsteuerung am Smartphone selbst oder auch an der Apple Watch.(Update: Die Regulierung der Lautstärke ist seit einigen Monaten am rechten Earbud durch Wischen nach oben bzw. unten möglich. In der Praxis funktioniert das Ganze nach ein wenig Übung einfach und zuverlässig.)Insgesamt ist die Bedienung mittels Touch-Steuerung bei den QuietComfort Earbuds sehr gut umgesetzt. Auch die Bedienung mittels Sprachsteuerung klappt problemlos. Die fehlenden Einstellungsmöglichkeiten werden vllt. mittels Update seitens Bose noch nachgereicht.Verarbeitung/Design:Die Bose QuietComfort Earbuds sind komplett aus Kunststoff gefertigt. Dies ist aber mittlerweile bei fast allen Geräten in dieser Preisklasse so und ist auch nicht weiter schlimm. Die Verarbeitung lässt keinen Grund zur Kritik zu. Scharfe Grate, unsaubere Passungen oder ähnliches sucht man hier vergebens. Insgesamt sind die QuietComfort wie auch schon die SoundSport free wireless tadellos verarbeitet.Das Design ist etwas gefälliger geworden und erinnert etwas an die Sony WF-1000XM3. Mir persönlich sagt das Design zu. Es ist modern und relativ schlicht gehalten. Die SoundSport wurden immer mal wieder dafür kritisiert, dass sie so weit aus den Ohren abstehen. Dies ist bei den QuietComfort Earbuds nicht mehr der Fall. Hier hat Bose auf die Kritik vieler Käufer reagiert.Das Ladecase ist ebenfalls sehr gut verarbeitet. Das Aufladen kann mittels USB-Typ C Kabel oder kabellos erfolgen. Die Earbuds sitzen sicher im Case und sind leicht entnehmbar. Im Vergleich zum Ladecase der Apple AirPods Pro wirkt es aber recht klobig. Trotz alledem sollte das Case in jede Hosentasche passen.Im Ergebnis bleibt festzustellen, dass die QuietComfort ein modernes und schlichtes Design bieten und sehr sauber verarbeitet sind.Tragekomfort/Sitz:Ein nicht unwichtiger Punkt bei einem In-Ear Kopfhörer ist der richtige Sitz. Bose liefert insgesamt 3 Ohreinsätze in den Größen S/1, M/2 und L/3 mit. Hier sollte eigentlich für jeden die richtige Größe dabei sein. Ich nutze die Größe M/2. Das Einsetzen ins Ohr klappt ohne Probleme. Ein großer Vorteil der Bose Kopfhörer ist der Bügel. Dadurch haben die Kopfhörer einen sehr guten und angenehmen Sitz im Ohr. Selbst beim Sport sitzen die Kopfhörer super und man braucht sich keine Sorgen darüber zu machen, dass die Earbuds rausfallen könnten. Bei den QuietComfort brauchte Bose im Gegensatz zu den SoundSport auch nicht viel verändern. Waren diese schon vom Sitz und Tragekomfort einfach nur perfekt. Letztgenannte sitzen meinem Empfinden nach sogar noch eine Spur fester und sicherer im Ohr. Gerade beim Sport merkt man das. Führt man schnelle Bewegungen bzw. Übungen, wie bspw. Burpees aus, rutscht der QuietComfort etwas im Ohr und muss ggf. wieder etwas ins Ohr gedrückt werden. Das passiert beim SoundSport nicht. Die AirPods Pro sitzen bei mir ebenfalls sehr sicher im Ohr und sind auf einem Level mit den QuietComfort. Allerdings vermitteln beide Bose Modelle ein sichereres Gefühl durch den Ohrbügel. Aber das ist vermutlich nur ein rein subjektives Empfinden.Vom Tragekomfort kann ich nichts negatives Berichten. Auch nach einigen Stunden habe ich keine Schmerzen oder ein unangenehmes Gefühl im Ohr.In Puncto Sitz und Tragekomfort hat Bose also wieder ganze Arbeit geleistet. Im Vergleich zum SoundSport free wireless muss sich der QuietComfort aber knapp geschlagen geben, da der erstgenannte einen noch besseren und strafferen Sitz bietet. Im Vergleich zu den AirPods Pro heißt es Unentschieden.Akku:Die Akkuleistung der QuietComfort geht absolut in Ordnung. Nach ca. 2 ½ Stunden Musik hören mit vollem Akku bei mittlerer bis annähernd voller Lautstärke mit aktivem ANC betrug der Akkustand noch 75 %. Bei beinahe leerem Akku (knapp 10%) waren nach 30 min im Ladecase wieder 80 % Ladestand erreicht. Eine Sache, die ich noch beobachten muss, ist die Selbstentladung. Über Nacht war der rechte Earbud nicht im Case und am nächsten Morgen haben beide Earbuds nur noch 10 % Akkustand gehabt, obwohl keine Wiedergabe erfolgte. Somit hat das Case den linken Earbud nicht geladen und dieser war wohl ebenfalls die ganze Nacht mit meinem iPhone verbunden.Active Noise Cancelling:Die aktive Geräuschunterdrückung des Bose QuietComfort arbeitet wirklich hervorragend. Die Geräuschunterdrückung ist in 10 Stufen einstellbar. Auf der höchsten Stufe ist man wirklich vom Rest der Umgebung abgeschnitten. Selbst Gespräche, die in unmittelbarer Umgebung geführt werden, sind fast nicht mehr wahrzunehmen. In der Natur schlagen sich die Bose ebenfalls klasse. Der Straßenverkehr wird komplett ausgeblendet und selbst Windgeräusche dringen nur sehr vereinzelt ins Ohr. Die AirPods Pro von Apple arbeiten hier auf einem fast ähnlich hohen Niveau. Letztendlich müssen sie sich den QuietComfort Earbuds aber knapp geschlagen geben.Man merkt Bose die jahrelange Erfahrung auf dem Gebiet der aktiven Geräuschunterdrückung einfach an. Wenn man will, kann man seine Umwelt fast komplett ausschließen und in seine Musik abtauchen.Klang:Kommen wir nun zum wichtigsten Kapitel bei einem Kopfhörer, dem Klang. Getestet habe ich die Kopfhörer mit verschiedenstem Material und Genres. Dazu gehörten ALAC-, MP3 und AAC-Dateien, sowie Titel von Spotify Premium in den Kategorien Dance, House, Electro, Pop und Klassik.Die Bose QuietComfort Earbuds haben einen sehr guten Klang. Im Gegensatz zu den SoundSport free wireless hat Bose den Hochton etwas angehoben und die Tiefen leicht zurückgenommen. Diese Abstimmung macht sich bei Liedern mit viel Gesang positiv bemerkbar. Die Grundabstimmung der Bose QuietComfort ist für meinen Geschmack gut gelungen. Die Kopfhörer spielen sehr ausgewogen, ohne dass irgendein Frequenzbereich zu dominant wäre. Stimmen klingen sehr sauber und auch die Bassleistung kann für einen In-Ear Kopfhörer dieser Größe vollends überzeugen. Die SoundSport free wireless sind im Gegensatz zu den QuietComfort Earbuds geringfügig wärmer abgestimmt mit etwas mehr Reserven im Bassbereich. Dadurch klingen diese nicht ganz so klar wie die Earbuds. Dieser Unterschied fällt aber nur auf, wenn man beide Kopfhörer direkt miteinander vergleicht. Die AirPods Pro sind im Klangkapitel für mich an dritter Stelle. Diese klingen zwar nicht schlecht und haben auch einen guten Klang, allerdings fehlt mir bei den AirPods das letzte Quäntchen Bass. Hier sind die Bose Kopfhörer besser aufgestellt.Die Lautstärke bei den QuietComfort ist für mein Empfinden ausreichend. Die SoundSport spielen aber einen ticken lauter.Kommen wir nun zu einem nicht unwichtigen Kritikpunkt der QuietComfort Kopfhörer. Das Rauschen. Sobald man das ANC ausstellt (Stufe 0 von 10) also den Transparenzmodus aktiviert und keine Musik spielt, ist ein wahrnehmbares Rauschen zu hören. Dieses ist erst nicht mehr zu hören, wenn die Geräuschunterdrückung auf Stufe 4 von 10 gestellt wird oder die Musik, der Film oder das Hörbuch etwas lauter gestellt wird. Bei der Musikwiedergabe fällt das Rauschen bei deaktiviertem ANC allerdings so gut wie nicht auf, aber bei der Wiedergabe eines Hörbuches (bei niedriger Lautstärke) oder Films mit leisen Passagen stört das Rauschen auf Dauer schon. Empfindliche Hörer dürften hier nicht ganz glücklich werden. Wer die Geräuschunterdrückung immer auf mind. Stufe 4 nutzt, sollte keine Probleme haben, denn dann sind die QuietComfort absolut still. Ich hoffe, dass Bose hier in Zukunft mittels Firmwareupdate noch nachbessert.Im Großen und Ganzen können die Bose QuietComfort klanglich überzeugen. Der Klang wirkt nie anstrengend und in Verbindung mit dem ausgezeichnet funktionierenden ANC kann man ganz und gar in seine Musik abtauchen. Leider trübt das Rauschen im Transparenzmodus den ansonsten tollen klanglichen Gesamteindruck.Fazit:UpdateMit den QuietComfort Earbuds liefert Bose ein in vielen Punkten sehr gelungenes Produkt mit nur wenigen Schwachpunkten ab. Für eine UVP von 272,90 € erhält man ein perfekt verarbeitetes, schlicht und modern aussehendes Paar Kopfhörer. Der Klang kann mit einem insgesamt stimmigen Gesamtbild mit klaren Höhen und weit hinabreichenden Bässen punkten. Im Vergleich zu den SoundSport free wireless hat Bose bei den QuietComfort Earbuds etwas mehr auf einen natürlicheren Klang mit saubereren Höhen und einem etwas weniger aufspielenden Bass gesetzt. Hier muss man entscheiden, was einem wichtiger ist. Ein Kritikpunkt beim Klang ist aber leider das Rauschen bei deaktiviertem ANC bzw. im Transparenzmodus, da dieses beim Hören von z. B. Hörbüchern oder leisen Filmpassagen wahrnehmbar ist und für empfindliche Hörer auch als störend empfunden werden kann. Die Bedienung läuft über die Touch-Steuerung problemlos. Leider fehlen aktuell noch einige Befehle, wie z. B. das Zurückspringen zum vorherigen Titel oder die Regelung der Lautstärke. Bei diesem Punkt sollte Bose über ein Firmwareupdate noch nachbessern. (Die Steuerung der Lautstärke ist nun über den rechten Earbud mittels Wischbewegung möglich). Die App bietet einen guten Funktionsumfang, ist übersichtlich aufgebaut und leicht zu bedienen. Für die Nutzung muss aber ein Benutzerkonto bei Bose angelegt werden. Insgesamt vergebe ich gute 4 Sterne für ein tolles Produkt aus dem Hause Bose. Der eine Stern Abzug erfolgt aufgrund des wahrnehmbaren Rauschens im Transparenzmodus und dem Registrierungszwang für die App-Nutzung (Registrierungszwang aufgehoben).Sollte man sich die QuietComfort Earbuds kaufen, wenn man bereits die Bose SoundSport free wireless besitzt? Die Antwort ist nicht ganz einfach, da bereits die SoundSport free wireless ein rundum gelungenes Produkt darstellen. Wer Wert auf ein wirklich toll funktionierendes ANC legt und einen etwas neutraleren Klang bevorzugt, sollte zu den QuietComfort Earbuds greifen. Wer mehr Bass und einen leicht besseren Sitz wünscht und auf ANC verzichten kann/will, wird auch mit den günstigeren SoundSport free wireless zufrieden sein. Die Apple AirPods Pro sind vor allem für Nutzer von Apple Geräten interessant, da die Integration und Bedienung auf einem gewohnt hohen Niveau sind. Allerdings sind die AirPods Pro meiner Meinung nach sowohl den SoundSport als auch den QuietComfort klanglich und vom Tragekomfort leicht unterlegen.Im Ergebnis kann ich momentan leider nur eine bedingte Kaufempfehlung aussprechen, da das Rauschen bei deaktivierten ANC bzw. im Transparenzmodus auf Dauer als störend einzustufen ist. Für diejenigen, die die Geräuschunterdrückung immer nutzen, stellt das Rauschen aber kein Problem dar. Für die sind die Bose QuietComfort eine klare Kaufempfehlung. Sollte Bose hier mittels Firmwareupdate nachbessern, werde ich meine Rezension anpassen.Positiv:- hochwertige Verarbeitung- angenehmer, ausgewogener und bassstarker Klang- sehr gut arbeitendes ANC- sehr guter Sitz und hoher Tragekomfort- (Neu) Bose reicht Verbesserungen mittels Update nachNegativ:- wahrnehmbares und teils störendes Rauschen bei deaktiviertem ANC bzw. im Transparenzmodus- mittels Touch-Steuerung (keine Anpassung der Lautstärke und) kein zurückspringen zum vorherigen Titel möglich- (Registrierungszwang für die App-Nutzung)Die Punkte in Klammern wurden inzwischen mittels Firmwareupdate ausgebessert.","Reviewed in Germany on 8 October 2020","Gute In-Ear Kopfhörer mit kleinen Schwächen","4.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61cOseOQ7uL.jpg

"R2CIC9ZXRGF8SZ","Nicola","Ho atteso un po’ per recensire in considerazione del fatto che le prime le ho dovute restituire poiché dopo una settimana non funzionavano più bene (restavano collegate anche dopo averle riposte nel case; gli auricolari funzionavano in base al volume: alto funzionava solo il destro, basso solo il sinistro, dunque per avere il pairing perfetto dovevo ascoltare la musica a volume medio. Alla fine non caricavano più e non si connettevano). Con il cambio (Amazon perfetta come sempre, chiesto il reso il giorno stesso è stato predisposto il cambio e la spedizione) oggi recensisco, dopo un mese circa, queste cuffie acquistate soprattutto per la loro qualità audio e devo dire che c’è davvero tutta. Come sempre bassi profondi ma che non coprono le altre tonalità, e un suono limpido che ti immerge nella musica e ti da il vero piacere di un ascolto che ti allontana da tutto. Le cuffie sono molto stabili una volta messe all’orecchio e non danno minimo cenno di poter cadere nemmeno durante gli allenamenti in palestra. Anche se sono abbastanza grandi, rispetto alla concorrenza, non pesano all’orecchio, io le indosso anche per diverse ore e non ne accuso fastidio. La connessione è immediata, appena rimosse dal case si collegano al mio telefono (iPhone 13 pro) e resta stabile senza mai dare cenno di perdita di segnale. Nell’uso di un solo auricolare per le chiamate la voce è limpida, quindi direi che svolgono il loro dovere egregiamente. La carica degli auricolari al 100% dura all’incirca 6 ore ascoltando musica e il case consente circa 2/3 ricariche complete. I comandi touch sulle cuffie sono comodi sia per alzare e abbassare il volume, per modificare la modalità di cancellazione del rumore, rispondere e riagganciare le chiamate, attivare l’assistente vocale e mandare avanti i brani musicali. Infine, il passaggio da un dispositivo all’altro è possibile premendo il bottoncino che si trova nel case, questa modalità non è comodissima, ma sinceramente il passaggio da un dispositivo (telefono) all’altro (computer) lo uso raramente quindi in definitiva la possibilità c’è e non mi crea problemi particolari, potrebbe essere un problema per chi ha più telefoni, ma basta avere un dispositivo dual sim che è più comodo in generale. Per quanto concerne la cancellazione del rumore, invece, devo dire che non sono soddisfattissimo (da questo le quattro stelle) perché quando metto le cuffie in modalità silenzio, l’isolamento non è totale ma continuo a sentire ciò che mi accade intorno, anche se in modo più soffuso ma, devo essere sincero, mi aspettavo un effetto molto più isolante. In definitiva devo dire che per l’ascolto della musica sono eccezionali (ho tra l’altro notato che se ascolto la musica da iPhone il volume resta molto più basso, ma se la musica la ascolto dal computer con lo stesso sevizio streaming, non posso andare con il volume oltre i due terzi altrimenti addio timpani) la connessione è perfetta come la comodità nell’utilizzo quotidiano e come i comandi touch sulle cuffie. Migliorabile l’effetto quiet confort non totalmente isolante.","Reviewed in Italy on 30 December 2021","Ottimo prodotto…migliorabile","4.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61eUREBPRyL.jpg

"R1KKUZ6VTROIBG","Retired CS Prof","The QuietComfort I ear buds from Bose were received and installed with minimum technical issues. However, the noise cancelling feature did not seem to work though it briefly started to work when I kept adjusting the bud in my ear. Although I tried the three existing earpiece sizes and the optional sizes, noise cancelling never worked because I could never get a good ear seal. So, customer service upgraded me free to the new QC II version but with the same result. Pity; nice features!In all this, customer service was overly polite and more than willing to help. They quickly shipped me different parts to try and the QC II. However, they never did pick up on the problem being air seal in the ear.Having tried all I could with the buds, I switched to the headset/earphones. Success. That works and works fantastically. The downside of headphones is size; but, oh well. Objective achieved though not perfectly. I give the headphones a 5  for functionality.I give their customer service a 5 for prompt and courteous service and the QC buds a 4 since I could never get them to work.Final note, on exchange, they have to receive the returned item before shipping the replacement (reasonable). They do pay shipping in both directions.When noise cancelling worked, the result was fantastic: driving down the road at 45 - 50 miles per with driver-side window open wide, it was completely quiet in my ear. If only the story could end there. That evening, the bud firmware was updated. On the next day, disaster: on the APP dashboard, there was the volume slider bar as usual but no Noise Cancelling slider bar and there was NO noise cancelling at all.Next I followed all the setting checks and steps listed on the website with no success. I made two calls to support (one got cut off) and they had me rerun all the steps I had just run with no success. Here is where the quality issues arose. Their help desk (clearly an outsource to foreign service) had only the above set of steps for problem diagnosis and correction. One got the impression that they were reading a script rather than thinking and had no imagination. They also had no level II support to consult or to whom they could pass on the issue.Finally, they had never seen the kind of problem I had. Here I fault Bose. I the APP software had a way of completely eliminating the Noise Cancelling slider, the programmer must have had a reason which is likely related to missing information from the hardware or firmware. Why not tell them what to do when this was seen? As I have managed support efforts in the past, I think that it's possible that a little work might be needed here.Their solution is to exchange the buds with a new set. When those come in, I will update this review. I so hope that this resolves the issue because I like all features (cosmetics, charging case, appearance, noise cancelling system)!Wait, there's more. Their exchange is unlike the rest of the world: they wait until they have the old product physically in their hands! Unfortunately, the agent did not tell me this though I was on the phone for over 30 minutes as he stated, restated, and restated facts. Furthermore, I waited several days to send the old ones until receiving the new!!! I finally guessed this to be their policy and sent them.Giving them a 1 for telephone support is quite generous.","Reviewed in the United States on 11 October 2022","It took a while but...","4.0 out of 5 stars","","11","Triple Black"
"RRRZYQOIWPM6A","Cassia Beltran","If you're planning on moving around a lot with these ear buds, you'll have complaints on ear-fit and wind static, a problem only exacerbated by very glichy software; but in terms of SOUND and noise cancellation, there's nothing better in the ear bud world. I use these primarily while I cross train, bike around town, or commute on the metro. A commuter's best friend, an athlete's bane.The bulk is kills them as hands-free devices during fast movement. They stick out the ear a LOT compared to Apple buds and their heavy to boot. This means that jumping around will dislodge them pretty quick unless you constantly adjust them in the ear (which I do, which is now my calling card at the gym - the girl who's ALWAYS fussing with her ear buds). The soft silicone bracket that hooks them in the ear are simply no match for their weight and, plus, if you're at all sweaty, the silicone gets slippery. For added tension, you can always try to up the size of the bracket, but no amount of tension is going to hold them in place when they're slippery. A light coating of felt would have alleviated some of this problem, but that wouldn't solve the problem of their overall bulk. That bulk catches wind like a cup and if you try to bike with these things, you won't hear anything but roaring wind rush pooling between your ear and the device.The constant need to readjust is made further annoying by the fact that the software is extremely glichy. If you have to constantly touch them, they're going to start doing weird things, like changing the noise-cancellation mode, stopping your music/podcast/call, switching your music/podcast/call, etc. EVEN IF YOU TURN OFF TOUCH CONTROLS, there's a level of touch sensitivity and software function that is simply built in to the device. Its so sensitive that the brush of a pony tail or shirt collar or a hat will start the device doing something you didn't want it to. As I said, it doesn't matter if you turn off touch controls in the setting; the thing has a life of its own.That software glichiness extends to other things like weird or inaccurate battery read-outs, the shutting off of one ear bud, and generally unfriendliness of use (from the iphone app). To change the noise cancellation mode, you have to click through three or four menus so if you have to move from a loud environment to a quiet one quickly, don't expect to be able to adjust the noise cancellation on a dime. You'll have to stop and scroll through menus galore.But they are the king of SOUND - simply the best I've ever heard and that's the reason I put up with them. In sound quality, they put Apple Pro's to shame. The Apple buds sound hollow and tinny compared to the lush surround-sound of the Boses'. The noise cancellation also puts the Apple buds to shame - they simply cancel out at least double the amount of white noise as the Apple's. Metro trains and airplanes - these things cancel out so much of it out, its AMAZING. Quiet and peaceful. Simply amazing. Plus, there's not enough motion or adjusting during a day-to-day commute to become annoying, its a beautiful way to travel.All in all, I find the sound quality and noise cancellation worth my constant wrestling with the fit or software, but how much patience you're willing to put into it is up to you.","Reviewed in the United States on 4 October 2022","Bulky & Awkward Fit / Sounds Amazing","4.0 out of 5 stars","","26","Triple Black"
"R3N3Z3E67XG8BM","Matthew Gertz","I bought these to replace a pair of Bose QC2's I'd had for years.  I like to use noise cancellation while I'm driving my tractor around on my ranch, but the QC2s, being wired, were a bit of a problem because the wire was always getting caught on something.  I decided to upgrade to these.First of all, the sound quality is amazing.  I'm hearing detail in songs that I'd never noticed before, even in the bass range (which is amazing for such a tiny speaker).  Of course, you'll get better bass from bigger speakers, but considering the size of these buds, I'm pretty well blown away by the ability to hear low tones loudly.  I was also pretty amazed by the noise cancellation in these; again, I wasn't expecting much from such small buds, but they block out probably 80% of the tractor noise, and when combined with a normal ear protection set, you might as well be in your own universe as far as engine noise is concerned.It took me a while to get them to fit properly, though.  I was unused to the ear-tip style of buds, and figuring out how to even position them in my ear was tricky.  But my biggest mistake was in not understanding what the sizes meant on the ear tips.  I have quite small ears, both pinna-wise and ear canal-size, and so I immediately tried using the smallest set.  They kept falling out of my ears, so I tried the medium ones -- those were better but they still had a tendency to fall out.  I finally realized that the sizes have nothing to do with the size of your ear canal or even the size of your pinnae -- they're actually relative to the distance from your ear canal to the back of the front fold of your pinna which, in my case, happens to be relatively far.  I used the largest set and finally they buds are staying in just fine; I could probably even run wearing them.The most problematic part of the buds are the controls.  It takes some training to control the volume via the right earbud; their documentation shows swipes going down the entire earbud, but in fact it seems to only involve the top half of the earbud in practice.  Putting in one bud will automatically start your music before the other bud is in, which I also find a bit annoying.  You can toggle noise cancellation by double-clicking the left bud, but instead of just quietly doing it for you, the software will announce which mode it's changing to, which is very annoying (and pretty unnecessary; you'll realize pretty quick whether it's on or off on your own).The charge case works well when placed on a normal QI charger.  (I thought the five LEDs on the front of the case were indicative of charge level, but it turns out that they aren't.)  The buds will completely lose their charge is sitting in the case for about a week (if you are not charging the case, that is), and I'm not comfortable leaving the case sitting on the charge pad for long periods of time, so I have to be planful about ensuring the buds are charged since I only use them a couple times a week.  My experience is that the buds only charge to about 90% (according to the Bose software), but the charge lasts for quite a while.  (In the 20 minutes it took me to type this, the charge really hasn't dipped at all, despite my having noise cancellation on and listening to music.)","Reviewed in the United States on 22 November 2021","Outstanding sound and noise reduction; ear tips are a bit hard to get right; controls can be tricky","4.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Triple Black"
"R32Q6F02JDW1G","pixelmania","Ich schreibe hier die Rezension weil ich mir die InEar Kopfhörer von Bose selbst gekauft habe und nicht als Tester angefragt wurde.Nach gefühlten 100 YouTube Videos über den Vergleich und die Eigenschaften der Bose QuietComfort im Vergleich zu allen anderen, habe ich meine Grundfragen nie beantwortet bekommen.Kann ich damit auch in Ruhe Podcasts oder Hörbücher hören?Höre ich mich selbst beim Essen, Reden oder Laufen? (Unter Punkt Tragekomfort)Warum diese Frage.. Ich habe mir einmal von JBL OverEar Kopfhörer gekauft und bei der „nicht“ Übertragung von Daten immer ein Grundrauschen bzw. Piepen im Ohr. Sobald man Musik startet ist dies immer noch vorhanden aber bei „lauter“ Musik natürlich nicht mehr zu hören. Bei Podcasts oder Hörbüchern ist dies aber immer vorhanden und mich nervt es einfach.Ich habe mich dann entschlossen zuerst TaoTronics 94, danach Jabra Elite 75, Sony 1000xm3 und dann Bose im gesamten Vergleich zu testen. Hier werde ich jetzt nicht auf alle eingehen sondern bei den entsprechenden Artikeln auch eine Rezension hinterlegen.Vorab für alle diejenigen die einfach nur diese Frage beantwortet haben möchten: Nein, es gibt bei Bose kein Grundrauschen!Bose an sich ist schon immer qualitativ als hochwertig anzusehen und hat mich auch hier im gesamten Vergleich nicht enttäuscht.Einige wichtige Punkte möchte ich hier aufgreifen, welche für viele entscheidend sind.ANC:Im Vergleich aller von mir getesteten Produkte, ist das ANC von Bose absolut überragend. Die Situation welche mich absolut überzeugt hat war tatsächlich in der Küche 😊Es wurde gekocht, die Dunstabzugshaube lief und A*exa war auf voller Lautstärke dabei Musik zu spielen. Auf der höchsten ANC Stufe habe ich nichts! davon gehört. Ich habe die Kopfhörer raus genommen und hatte Schmerzen in den Ohren, da alles so laut war 😊Gleichzeitig ist das geniale ANC aber auch ein wenig angsteinflößend, da man wirklich nichts hören kann. Aber dafür.. gibt es ja die Möglichkeit dies zu steuern.App:Viele schreiben hier was man alles in der App nicht einstellen kann und wie bescheiden das doch ist. Ich war davon etwas beeinflusst und habe somit skeptisch die App gestartet. Im Vergleich zu allen anderen Produkten ist die App von Bose  wirklich sehr minimalistisch. Aber, es beinhaltet alle Grundfunktionen. Nach kurzer Zeit habe ich gemerkt, dass alle wichtigen Eigenschaften damit gesteuert werden können.. ANC Level, Lautstärke, Play/Pause, Ein Lied überspringen und auch das Starten von dem Assistenten(Für mich uninteressant).In den anderen Apps kann man den EQ manuell einstellen, voreingestellte Profile nutzen und alle Tap Optionen konfigurieren. Am Anfang sehr interessant und spannend.. später nutzt man es auch nicht mehr 😊Sound:Der Sound ist sehr ausgeglichen und angenehm, auch bei voller Lautstärke. Bei anderen Produkten gab es auch mehr Bass aber teilweise waren die Höhen extremer und „klirrend“. Der Bass reicht hier „in meinen Augen“ aus. Teilweise haben die Handys oder auch Musik-Apps auch EQ wo man etwas konfigurieren kann.Tragekomfort:Die Bose haben ein eigenes System, welches aber sehr angenehm zu tragen ist und auch auf lange Zeit nicht stört oder drückt. Die Kopfhörer sitzen auch so, dass man sich nicht so extrem beim Essen, Reden oder Laufen hört.Laufzeit:Keine Diskussionen welches Produkt nun 5, 6 oder 7 Stunden läuft.. In meinem Fall habe ich es bis jetzt noch nicht unter 50% Akku geschafft, selbst nach 70 Minuten Telefonat war ich erst bei 60%. 2 weitere Stunden oder mehr hätten die Marke wahrscheinlich geknackt.Telefonieren:Der wichtigste Punkt hierbei und auch generell, man kann sich selbst verstehen! Dies ist sogar über die App einstellbar.Ladecase:Kurz und knapp (also nicht wie meine gesamte Bewertung). Das Case ist viel viel viel zu groß ☹. Alle anderen haben schön in die Hosen- oder Jackentasche gepasst. Hier keine Chance.. Ich hoffe Bose entwickelt noch ein Case was man sich zusätzlich kaufen kann mit kleinerem Akku und somit Hosentaschen-Größe.Fazit:Ich werde Sie behalten. Also von mir aus Daumen hoch. Aber auch nur 4 Sterne wegen dem Case.","Reviewed in Germany on 30 December 2020","Mal eine objektive Bewertung für die Alltagsnutzer","4.0 out of 5 stars","","22","Triple Black"
"RK0Q22WOCQNBH","Simone","Non mi dilungherò sulla qualità del prodotto dal punto di vista della resa audio nè da quello costruttivo, dei materiali ecc in quanto si sa che Bose offre sempre livelli decisamene alti, preferisco spendere qualche parola sulla funzionalità pratica di queste cuffie.Comincio col dire che le ho scelte principalmente in quanto lavorando su turni, mi riesce difficile dormire durante il giorno circondato da rumori esterni quali auto, camion, lavori, bambini ecc per cui avere la possibilità di indossare delle cuffie compatte che riducono incredibilmente il rumore è già di per sè qualcosa di indispensabile. Cercavo anche delle cuffie da poter indossare durante l’allenamento e che rimanessero ben salde nonostante i movimenti continui.Bene, fin qui una manna dal cielo, una volta indossate le cuffie non si schiodano e se impostate al livello massimo di riduzione del rumore assicurano un isolamento ottimale dall’ambiente che ci circonda.Utilizzate tramite AirPlay offrono una qualità audio ottima senza incertezze. Il problema sorge quando le collego alla Bose Smart Soundbar 300 tramite il sistema proprietario SimpleSync, così da poter guardare film o ascoltare musica dal televisore senza disturbare: l’audio presenta frequenti salti ed interruzioni simili ad interferenze che non mi so spiegare, sarà che sono ben abituato al concentro di assoluta compatibilità ed integrazione tra i prodotti Apple... ma possibile che due prodotti tanto recenti non siano adeguatamente ottimizzati per funzionare in simbiosi?Mi ero quasi rassegnato, quando ho scoperto la possibilità di collegare le cuffie ad Amazon Fire TV Stick (che utilizzo come sistema principale in quanto il sistema operativo della mia Smart TV risulta ormai obsoleto) in modo semplice ed indolore, ma soprattutto con una riproduzione dell’audio senza alcuna incertezza.Installando la app VLC è inoltre possibile riproduttore musica e file vari da chiavetta usb inserita nel router o, tramite altre app, inserita direttamente nel televisore.Per cui finalmente ho la possibilità di sfruttare le cuffie come si deve al loro massimo potenziale.Con la durata della batteria mi trovo veramente bene ed è davvero raro ritrovarsi a secco.Il prodotto non è perfetto, ma se acquistate con la giusta consapevolezza possono rivelarsi ottime, se in linea alle proprie esigenze come nel mio caso.","Reviewed in Italy on 20 June 2021","Ottimo prodotto","4.0 out of 5 stars","","13","Triple Black"
"RNE0QPX5KRN76","Loki","These earbuds are extremely convenient for my use case, which is office use and use while driving. From a pure convenience perspective, these are almost perfect. They block out noise as you might expect for a good noise cancellation system. I would say that the overall noise cancellation is better than over-ear offerings from Bose like the QC 35 II or the NC 700 (both of which I have). They are solid in my ear, and come with 3 sizes of tips. I have used them jogging and not been worried about them falling out. The touch controls are easy to use and configurable with their app. The pass-through mode in particular comes in handy for me, and it is easy to switch to quickly. No need to ever take them out. They work well in the car as well. The sound is about what you might expect from Bose, just fine for the vast majority of people.The main issue is the case. The charging case is just too thick. It would be better if they made it longer or wider instead of thicker. My only other complaint is that they are uncomfortable for longer usage. The wedge-shape may be great for noise isolation, but it is not great for long-term user comfort. This only becomes an issue after an hour or more of using for me. Your mileage may vary.This isn't a complaint per-se, but it is a consideration. Every time you buy a device with a battery inside, you are buying a device with an expiration date. At some point you will end up throwing these away. I don't even mean this as an environmental thing either, just worth considering that these will last you maybe 2 years, 3 or 4 if you are careful with them. Less if you use them enough to wear out the battery quicker. You could spend less money on something like the Meze 99 classics/neos and a FiiO BTR5 to power them, for about the same amount of money, and have the headphones last you 20 years or more with care. Not to mention that the sound quality would be far greater.For the audiophile perspective, the sound is OK at best. I do not use these for recreational listening at all. They are fine to use in the office, but I find myself listening to less and less music and just using the noise cancellation or listening to a podcast. This is because while me from 5 years ago quite liked the sound of Bose in general (big step up from ""free"" apple earbuds), now I am seriously into audiophile gear; I only use these for the sheer convenience they offer. The sound quality is just not great. Again, they are just fine for the vast majority of people. If you are an audiophile, they will not sound good to you.","Reviewed in the United States on 19 September 2022","Extremely convenient.","4.0 out of 5 stars","","12","Triple Black"
"R3OS15UTOJM2PL","Michael Rodriguez","UPDATEI went out and spent $60 upgrading the bluetooth receiver in my desktop. Since then I've had no issues with the Bose earbuds. They've been working perfectly for the last few weeks. Apparently the Realtek receiver built into the mobo of my HP was absolute garbage. The new TP-Link AX3000 WiFi 6 PCIe works like a charm. I've not experienced any random disconnects, the weird 'helium' issue, or skipping. Wish I'd burned that $60 earlier. Would have kept me from pulling so much hair out.ORIGINALI use my earbuds for 3 devices - my HP home PC, my Huawei laptop and my Android 10e phone. These shine on the phone - they work flawlessly every time. I've had no issues that I can recall connecting or using them with my phone (outside of any software limitations they come with). With my laptop, they're very good most of the time. They're very reliable and I don't have too many issues. With my PC, they're bad enough to make me want to tear them out of my ears and smash them on the floor. I have every conceivable issue once I try to use them with my PC. It's likely a driver issue but there's no way to get Bose and RealTek talking to each other and Bose support can't do anything. When they initially connect audio is pitched about an octave higher than they should; voices sound like people are sucking helium; audio skips. Disconnecting and reconnecting is the only solution. Even after reconnecting, they frequently skip, sometimes once in a while, sometimes once per second. They also disconnect and reboot themselves frequently, sometimes at the end of a Youtube video or a video game after I stop the audio, sometimes at random. More recently, they just don't want to connect. I have to go into the Win10 Bluetooth menu and click Connect 5+ times over the course of 1-2 minutes to get them to work. It's truly unfortunate they're this bad. I've tried 2 different bluetooth dongles and a separate audio card. I've had 3 different sets of these (broke one pair, one pair stopped charging, and the current pair) with the same exact problems. I can NOT recommend these for PC use. My PC is an HP Envy TE01-1050 with a Realtek Wi-Fi 5 (1x1) and Bluetooth 4.2 Combo. I going to switch these solely to phone use outside the house and buy a cheapo pair of ANC headphones for computer use.

En fait c'est pas si démesuré que cela.Si je peu comparer le son il sont légèrement en dessous des Sony et Devialet au niveau des aigus. par contre les basses sont bien équilibrées et justes.Un équalyseur 3 bandes vient corriger en grande partie ce problème.mon avis c'est qu'il faut faire des choix.pour moi le premier c'est le confort et la ils sont excellents, ils tiennent, on peut les enlever et les mettre avec facilité et ils ne font pas mal au conduit auditif.ce critère est important, car avec avec les autres, il faut modeler les embouts à mémoire de forme les tenir enfoncés pour étouffer les bruits exterieurs et en plus c'est insupportable.Pour moi maniabilité et confort sont des critères très importants.J'en viens au deuxième point important la réduction de bruit.

"R32MSOJJXQGZZ9","Luca","La mia esperienza con queste cuffiette è molto positiva salvo per qualche piccola pecca. Parlando prima dei pregi, la qualità del suono è ottima, sia come suono che come qualità dei bassi.  La cancellazione del rumore risulta piuttosto efficiente, anche se non ho avuto modo di confrontarle con altre marche, ma ad ogni modo fa bene il suo lavoro. L’unica pecca riguardo alla cancellazione del rumore, ho riscontrato che se le cuffie le usi dove vicino a te hai il rumore dell’aria compressa, tipo se usi la pistola ad aria compressa, questa va a contrastare completamente la cancellazione del rumore dando non poco fastidio; comunque si tratta di un caso particolare. Quello che invece non ho particolarmente apprezzato è l’aderenza all’orecchio; rimangono salde una volta messe bene, quindi ti può muovere tranquillamente senza che le cuffie ti cadono dall’orecchio. Però mettersele bene all’orecchio non è proprio così semplice e intuitivo, e a volte rischi di metterle male e allora si, ti possono cadere. Poi almeno per quel che riguarda I’m mio orecchio ovviamente, anche se uso il l’archetto più piccolo in dotazione, dopo un po’ di tempo iniziano a darmi farstidio all’orecchio costringendomi a doverle togliere. Ultima cosa che non mi è piaciuta moltissimo è il designe quando te le metti adossso; non sono  molto piccole e apprezzabili come magari altri brand. Ad ogni modo la qualità del prodotto è molto altra;  d’altronde visto il prezzo ci mancherebbe che non lo fosse…In conclusione su certi piccoli aspetti si potrebbero migliorare, comunque per chi cerca delle cuffie di alta qualità ne consiglio l’acquisto.","Reviewed in Italy on 23 September 2022","Ottime ma si poteva fare un po’ meglio","4.0 out of 5 stars","","7","Triple Black"
"R2L06EYYSR0JUM","Zed","QC II review...Okay,I'm just going to speak about how these compare to my original QC buds (mostly).I was a Samsung buds user for several gens years but between the fact that I like the bose fit better and Samsung buds tend to give me ""swimmers ear"" (infection) with some models (Google it, many have brought this up) I switched to Bose.The new buds are much improved in several areas that matter to me...- much improved touch controls (big improvement)- much smaller and lighter (not a huge deal to me but nice)- noise cancelling is improved (esp active noise cancelling or whatever they call their adaptive mode)Couple issues...- they dropped wireless charging - really dumb but not that big of a deal to me- I really liked the old ear tip for comfort better (but many did not)- crazy expensive (luckily I was able to sell my original QC's for a decent price)- Still IPX4, they need to up these to IPX7 at this price!Overall, I'm a fan of these.Also, for those who need a larger or very small eartip Bose sells an alternate ear tip kit for a couple bucks (an extra small and extra large).If the sticker price doesn't scare you away they are a great buy.---My review of the original QC's...I've had a lot of Bose in ears but this is my first set of Bose true wireless. I have always liked that they don't go all the way in your ear. That is a big deal for me and makes wearing in ears much more comfortable for me.I've been using Samsung buds for my last 3 sets of in ears but I finally gave up on them because of poor fit and they just weren't comfortable for me.For me the pluses of the Bose...* very comfortable (though 5 sets, instead if 3, of wingtips would have been even better).* great sound* really good ANC for buds* touch controls work well (swipe for volume is especially nice)The negatives...* battery life should be better considering how big these are* case is comically huge* touch controls should be much more customizable (long press and double tap should be able to be assigned to what ever you want)I'm glad I waited for the sale ($279 was more what I was willing to pay) and am hoping Bose keeps upgrading the firmware to take care of the more customizable controls issue.Overall, I'm happy that I switched from Samsung to Bose.","Reviewed in the United States on 16 October 2021","QC II","4.0 out of 5 stars","","2","Triple Black"

I prefer to use an earbud in my left side only in many situations so I can keep my ""good ear"" available to the outside world.  Still recommended for sound quality and ANC.Compared to my other earbuds, Power Beats Pro, the controls on the BOSE QC are lacking in features and ease of use.  Given the $200-$270 price tag of the BOSE QC, they need a redesign with controls in mind.I also have some numbness on my left 2 fingers and thumb, so the touch controls are difficult to feel.The Power Beat Pros have raised controls so I can feel those despite the finger numbness.Many will find the lack of raised controls a feature.","Reviewed in the United States on 4 August 2022","Left Bud Failed after 10 months, BOSE replaced hassle free.

"R1T4PLN3VAZCET","JSmith","A few pros and cons after one week with the new Bose Quiet Comfort Noise Cancelling Earbuds:Pros:1. Sound separation and overall clarity is excellent.2. Good battery life. These can be used for most of the day (I got 5-6 hours at max sound volume).3. Sound quality of microphones is adequate. Most of my customers reported being able to hear me fine.4. Case is beautiful and works great. I love that you can wirelessly charge the case. You can get two full charges from the case if needed.5. Charging the earbuds is very fast. In one hour I went from 0 to 50%.Cons:1. The highs are a bit harsh/undefined.2. The overall sound level even on max volume is very low. I understand protecting people's eardrums but I like listening to music LOUD. You just can't hear the music as loud as you want with these earbuds.3. Bass is ok, just ok. Not thundering. Anyone who says the bass even approaches that of good wireless headphones is wrong.4. Overall fit is good but I personally had issues with my right ear getting a good tight fit no matter which of the three sizes I tried. This won't be a problem for most people I don't think but I thought it fair to list it anyway.5. Lack of software and earbud controls. A few things are missing:  There's no equalizer, there's no microphone mute, there's no skipping back to the previous song.6. Honestly I could tell VERY LITTLE difference between levels 1 and 10 of noise cancelling. For me if you want noise cancelling these are not a good option.7. The user is required to firmly ""tap"" your earbuds to advance to the next track, accept/close a phone call or change the noise cancelling level. The problem with this tapping method is that when you tap the earbuds it's very LOUD and somewhat painful to the ear. I don't know what would be a better system but I don't like this method.8. With my iPhone XR I found that you have to tweak your Settings by: Setting your sound equalizer to Bass Booster and other settings (Accessibility--Headphone Accommodation--Balanced Tone Strong) to achieve maximum clarity.Overall this is a good attempt by Bose at their first generation of noise cancelling earbuds. I expected more to be honest.UPDATE after two full months of using this product:  Nothing has changed. See my above comments. Still quite disappointed in the overall volume level being so low. Thank you Bose for protecting my ears BUT I should be the one to determine the overall volume level not you.","Reviewed in the United States on 26 October 2020","Best on the market but still not perfect","4.0 out of 5 stars","","13","Soapstone"
"R12MHN4OX3VSLS","Tom Kato","I bought these after looking at the Jabra 85t, Anker, and others. I have and Aikela that I bought years ago where the battery dies, doesn't charge, and wanted an upgrade.First point: Pairing - Read the instructions! While full details are not included, it was simple as going to Bose website to find them. I was able to pair it instantly with my iPhone. I then followed the instructions to then pair with iPad, and then work PC. (Bulky headset before, this is a lot nicer!)Second point: Sound quality - Really, really good. When I paired with the iPhone, I was able to play with the settings. Of course, being Christmas, had TSO playing. The sound quality was great!Third point: Fit - These are tight. A lot tighter than the Aikela. I switched to the smaller ear piece and it is still tight. I do plan on using this for hiking, so I am looking forward to see how this will work. However, my only concern is that over a period of time until my ear gets used to it, there will be a little pain. I would rather suffer through the pain then lose the bud.Fourth point: Controls. With the app, controls are nice, but not great. I will see how it works on my hikes and trail runs.I will be using these on my Windows PC for work meetings and on my iPhone. From initial reactions, the voice comes through crystal clear on my meetings. I have yet to try calls on the iPhone.Why not 5 stars? So far, still want to explore them. It may go to 5 as I get used to using them more, but it may go down also. There have been comments on battery life, pairing, etc. So far, I have not experienced any of those.As I use these more, I'll add to the updates.Update: Dec 26 - Fit - Fit matters! I did switch out to the smaller ear piece and ANC was non existent. When I went back to the normal size, ANC worked just fine. However, after 2 hours in my ear, there was a bit of pain from the tightness of the fit. A day later, it was gone.

"R1UHD2NI7Q29YX","Zachary Grigg","After having this product for one day, it is hard to speak on longevity in this review - will provide a new update in the coming months.As an avid Bose customer for many years, this product felt like a safe bet on what I'm used to with headphones. If you're a Bose fan, frequent commuter or traveler, you will love these. The high quality sound and excellent noise cancellation Bose products possess are retained in this product. Well-balanced, clear sound at normal volumes are present, though sound adjustments are not available like some competitors offer. Furthermore, sound quality is by no means the best around anymore even if it is good. Noise cancellation is step up on already excellent quality in previous Bose headphones I have owned. Other reviewers seem to agree with this feature of the product as well.For the most part, these headphones are easy to use for daily life. Well-instructed set-up with the Bose Music app, though some common headphone features are not easily present. Volume controls are available by swiping up/down on the right earbud. This feature is a bit finicky and doesn't always work smoothly. Furthermore, it must be toggled on in the app settings to work. The rest of controls available on the earbuds are straight forward and become easier to use over time. Only lacking feature is going back to a song - maybe this will be corrected soon.Bluetooth connectivity is strong, battery life is slightly below average among competitors (likely a result of noise cancelling), although the case does help and quick charging exists. Battery should last for an average trip or days worth of usage (between the headphones and case).These headphones are comfortable and secured when you use the correct ear tip. Contrary to some reviews, I feel these look good while being a bit bigger than some competitors. Carrying case is not very compact, having it in your pocket will feel weird. Water resistance is as advertised and these will likely be great for workouts. Speaking of which, if you do not like noise cancelling it can easily be adjusted an one-earbud listening does is a present feature. Lastly, the price is steep, but Bose products have always lasted me for at least 2+ years.Overall great all-around wireless earbuds that I will recommend any day along with Bose's excellent customer service. Only suggestion to interested buyers would be to look at other headphones and decide what one works best for your lifestyle.","Reviewed in the United States on 5 May 2021","Superb Noise Cancelling, Good Sound Quality","4.0 out of 5 stars","","3","Triple Black"

Das Problem bei den AirPods war ein Fehler in einer Produktionsmarge, die mich zu einem Wechsel veranlasst haben.Aber nun zu den Bose:Eine schöne schlichte Verpackung mit allem notwendigen, was man braucht. 3 Verschiedene Aufsätze und ein Kabel waren dabei.Entgegen der Meinung von vielen ist das Case in meinen Augen zwar groß, aber nicht zu groß, denn es passt in meinen Augen recht gut in eine normale (Herren-)Hosentasche.+ Im direkten Vergleich zu den AirPods ist der Sound der Bose überragen. Grundsätzlich bin ich der Meinung, dass die Klangqualität bei Bose schwer zu übertreffen ist.+ Auch das Noisecancelling ist im direkten Vergleich deutlich besser als das der AirPods. Jedoch sind sie anfällig bei starkem Wind, daher empfiehlt es sich hier eine Mütze zu tragen. Hier ist mir auch keine Probleme aufgefallen.+ Die Bedienung finde ich großartig gelungen. Zwar fehlt eine Option, um einen Titel zurück zu springen, allerdings braucht man das nicht zwingend. Die unterschiedlichen Bedienelemente sind unterschiedlich an den Kopfhörern untergebracht, was ein bisschen Gewöhnung bedarf, aber es ist schnell klar, was wo ist. Super finde ich die Möglichkeit der Lautstärkensteuerung am rechten Earbud.+/- Die Bluetoothverbingung ist gut, wenn sie hergestellt ist. Allerdings braucht es manchmal ein/zwei Versuche, bis sie sauber verbinden. Und es dauert 1/2 Sekunden bis sie Verbunden sind, anders als bei den AirPods.+ Die Akkulaufzeit ist gut und reicht locker aus.+/- Die App ist Okay, allerdings ist die Anmeldung, die zwingen ist etwas überflüssig. Die App an sich ist gut, alles kann auch darüber eingestellt werden und es können bestimmte Shortcuts für das NC gesetzt werden, die sehr gut helfen, um bspw während dem Laufen geügend von seiner Umgebung mitzubekommen oder in der Bahn Nichts. Wenn man eh im Bose Universum ist, oder da hinein will ist die App sowieso von großem NutzenIch kann die Kopfhörer wärmstens empfehlen und obwohl 220.- Euro sehr teuer sind lohnt es sich zu Bose zu gehen - auch wenn man von den AirPods Pro kommt.","Reviewed in Germany on 20 February 2021","Rundum gut gelungene Kopfhörer","4.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Triple Black"
"R1OY5GT2Y3U7Z1","ORrick","These earbuds have very good sound cancelling performance.  There are three levels of cancellation so you can actually hear someone talking to you if desired or tune everything out.  My wife's favorite application is that I can group the earbuds with my Bose Soundbar so I can watch TV after she turns in for the evening without disturbing her.  With sound cancelling, you can listen to your programs at a lower volume and still get great sound quality.  Really like that.  I haven't measured battery life but I know I can easily watch a couple of feature length movies before needing a recharge.  On rare occasion, the left and right channel have become out of phase with each other which I correct by momentarily returning the earbuds to there charging case and then removing again for use (like a reset). Has not been a significant problem at all.  The on-line setup and support website could use some work however.  This is the main reason for only 4 stars. I have ended up at a dead end a couple times when initially linking the earbuds to other devices and grouping with the Soundbar.  It seams that one device simply can't always discover the other.  Have patience and you'll get through it.","Reviewed in the United States on 4 January 2023","Group with a Bose Soundbar for late night TV watching that does not disturb the household.","4.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Triple Black"
"R27OQNFW4P1DGR","Deportivo","Meine älteren Bose QC 30 nutzte ich oft nur mit der Geräuschunterdrückung (ANC) um Ruhe zu haben. Beispielsweise bei konzentrierter Einzelarbeit im Büro oder auf der Gartenliege, wenn die Nachbarn zeitgleich bei der Gartenarbeit sind. Was mich an den bisherigen QC 30 störte waren die kurzen Kabel zum Nackenband. Diese produzieren bereits bei leichten Bewegungen störende Geräusche, gerade bei Hemden oder Pullovern mit Kragen.Insofern war ich sehr auf die neuen völlig kabellosen Kopfhörer von Bose mit der aktuellen Geräuschunterdrückung gespannt. Sie kamen gestern über Amazon an.Die Geräuschunterdrückung ist deutlich besser als bei den QC 30, die bereits sehr gut sind. Ich denke, für True Wireless Kopfhörer ist es derzeit das beste ANC auf dem Markt, auch sehr deutlich besser als bei den AirPods Pro, Libratone, Huawei, Sennheiser. Neuere ANC-In-Ears von Sony habe ich nicht probegehört.Die Bose QC Earbuds klingen sehr natürlich, mit einem schönen Bass. Der Tragekomfort gewohnt bequem mit den Silikonflügeln. Es entsteht aber erstmalig für mich bei Bose manchmal ein leichtes Pfropfen- oder Druckgefühl im Ohr. Hierdurch kann ich mich auch verstärkt Atmen hören. Apple hat das bei den AirPods Pro dadurch gelöst, da sie für einen Druckausgleich an den Ohrstöpseln gesorgt haben. Ob die Bose einen Druckausgleich haben weiß ich nicht. Vielleicht liegt das Druckgefühl aber auch an dem höheren Gewicht der Bose im Vergleich zu den AirPods Pro. Bei Bose muss ich die In Ears bei störendem Druck etwas lockern. Hierfür einen halben Stern Abzug.Die AirPods Pro habe ich aber verworfen, da ich für deren Software-Updates ein iPhone bräuchte und ich nutze eben Android, außerdem ist das ANC sehr viel schwächer.Bei der Bedienung vermisse ich die Lautstärkeregelung und die Titel zurück Funktion, das kostet ebenfalls einen halben Stern.Positiv finde ich, dass sie mit dem Samsung Assistenten Bixby zusammenarbeiten, hierdurch kann man die Lautstärke aber auch Titel vor und zurück per Sprachbefehl regeln lassen.Mit dem Case komme ich klar, die Entriegelungstaste hätte etwas bequemer sein können.Insgesamt bin ich bisher sehr zufrieden und werde meine bisher genutzten Bose verkaufen.Sofern sich neue Erkenntnisse ergeben, werde ich gerne darüber berichten.","Reviewed in Germany on 7 October 2020","Schöner Klang, beste Geräuschdämpfung!","4.0 out of 5 stars","","2","Triple Black"
"RTS8UBTEWYP69","Claudia Müller","Ich hatte bislang die Airpods pro in der Verwendung. Aber da ist jetzt ein ""Löffel"" stumm. Also wollte ich was Neues.Am Fr-Abend bestellt, am Sa-Abend gekommen.Hier gibt es nichts zu klagen.Verpackung war auch ansprechend und OK.Case: im Vergleich zu den Airpods pro schon eine riesen Schachtel. Mit in die Jogginghose stecken und ab ins Fitness ist es da nicht möglich.Die Kopfhörer machen einen wertigen Eindruck. Waren auch gleich einsatzbereit. Das fand ich super!! Verbinden mit meinem Xiaomi-Handy war easy.Dann in die Ohren ""gepuhlt"" und vom 1. Puhlen bis jetzt ist hier mein Bauch, der dagegen spricht.Es fühlt sich an, wie extrem unbequeme enge und steife Schuhe. solche Schuhe werden niemals Lieblingsschuhe.Was mich aber gleich abholte, dass ich sofort gedämpft den TV hörte. Sprich: meine Außengeräusche hatten Hausverbot in meinem Gehörgang und dann kam der Sound.JESUS!! Da stand ich und tanzte und sang mit.Und aufgrund vom Sound probiere ich jetzt die verschiedenen Silikonnubsis aus und hoffe, dass sich meine Ohrknorpel an den Druck gewöhnen.Ich bin so vom Sound begeistert, aber sie sind unbequem.Jetzt habe ich mir richtige Kopfhörer von Bose bestellt und hangel mich jetzt so heran.Ich melde mich, wie meine Wahl ausging.Upgrade: ich habe die In-ears behalten und heute liebe ich sie. Ich nutze sie ständig. Beim Radfahren, abends auf der Couch und im Fitness.An meinem rechten Ohr hab ich am Knorpel einen Piercing. Der drückt ab + zu, was teilweise auch echt schmerzhaft ist.Aber ansonsten sitzen die Teile wirklich gut und vom Klang bin ich jedes Mal so angetoucht, dass ich Gänsehaut habe!","Reviewed in Germany on 14 March 2022","Erst kurz in der Testphase-upgrade: Juli 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Soapstone"
"RL55T8MZQ5B8B","Hockeyguyx","So I've been in the market for a decent set of earbuds for ages, and these stuck out to me, I've been using these for the past 2 weeks and I can say it's a love hate relationship.Pros:- These seemed to fit my ears the best, they don't fall out, and they have several tip options- Sound quality (from my experience) is excellent, leans a bit bass heavy but I definitely prefer that- Battery life is decent, nothing special, but doesn't do the annoying low battery warnings repetitively every 10 seconds- this is my first set with active noise cancelling and I can say it is a game changer, tunes out most of the loud noise around- Charges using USB-C big plus in my bookCons:- the Case is a bit large, not really something you want to keep in a pocket- I've found the bluetooth to be pretty funky sometimes (Used with Iphone 14), it has trouble connecting sometimes, especially if you are only using one earbud- the charging system feels kind of cheap for the premium price tag, the magnetic charging feels pretty weak and i have doubts with how it'll hold up long term","Reviewed in the United States on 12 December 2022","Almost a perfect set of earbuds","4.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Soapstone"
"R2GM6TWAWH1IO1","Joe Consumer","I used to have the wired NC buds, then went to airpods pro, then back to Bose. These are definitely comfortable, and the features are nice, but I find these must ""seal"" better in my ears than the old wired NC buds.  They are still better than airpods pro, IMO, whose seal would fade after 10 minutes or so. These, at least, stay seated longer and thus provide better ANR.  One thing that happens frequently that really irks me is I'll go to use them, take them out of the case and they are completely dead. This is after they have been in the case for hours to days.  Make sure to ALWAYS check to make sure they are connected in the case by verifying the white lights flash when you put them in. If not, enjoy the dead earbuds next time you go to use them.  Not sure why that aspect of the design is so fragile, but it is, and its a pain.  Oh, and what the heck is with the gigantic case anyway.  Bose didn't seem to try very hard to make this more compact.","Reviewed in the United States on 15 January 2023","Needs a tight seal to be effective","4.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Triple Black"
